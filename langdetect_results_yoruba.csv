"Hello everyone,

I’m trying to find the most accurate or culturally appropriate Yoruba phrase for “Created in Heaven.” I’ve been told by my Yoruba-speaking parents that there isn’t a direct translation for this phrase because Yoruba is a context-heavy language, and certain concepts like “heaven” don’t always map directly the way they do in English. 

Still, I want to get as close as possible to the meaning behind “Created in Heaven” something that captures the idea of divine origin, uniqueness, or being spiritually crafted.

As of right now I have this phrase, “Àkàndá Olórun (God’s specially made creation)” which was given by my parents and I’m settling on for now but I would love any other or closer translations for created in heaven. Thank you",en,1.0

"In the Yoruba language Lesbian and Gaism mean the samething, and we call this ""ABOOYW+""

In the Yoruba language Lesbian and Gaism both mean the samething, they fall under the words: Adefuro, Adodi, Ado, and Agbere. All these 4 words start with the letter ""A"". Bisexual is the word use for a human who has sex with both Male and Females and in Yoruba we say, ""eni ti o ba okunrin ati obinrin lopọ"" this literally means ""one who has sex with both man and women"" the letter denoted for this would be ""BOOLP"" which is for ""ba okunrin ati obinrin lopọ."" In Yoruba the words transgender is ""eni ti o fẹ yi ara rẹ pada"" this literally means, ""one who wants to change his or her body"" the letter denoted for this would be ""YAP"" this is ""Yi ara pada."" And in Yoruba the word queer is and easy one to say, ""wèrè"" this means ""one who is crazy or has lost his or her mind."" So there you have it, the word LGBTQ+ in Yoruba is translated as ""ABOOLPYAPW"" and because obviously this word is to long and is easy to forget, it should be shortened to ABOOYW+. Again the ""A"" stand for ""Adefuro,"" ""Adodi,"" ""Ado,"" and ""Agbere."" The ""B"" stand for ""Ba Okunrin ati Obinrin lopọ."" The ""Y"" stand for ""yi"" which can mean to change as in rotate like a circle, which refers to them changing and transitioning from a man to woman or woman to man. And lastly the ""W"" stand for ""wèrè"" which just means a ""mentally insane person."" So there you have it, LGBTQ+ in Yoruba is ""ABOOYW+""

"Hi everyone

I (23F) was born and raised in the US, and while my parents mostly spoke English to me growing up, both of my grandmothers spoke Yoruba. Because of that, I have a very basic understanding of the language. I can follow conversations and understand what is being said, but I never really learned how to respond in Yoruba. I always answered in English.

Now that I am 23, I feel a strong desire to embrace my culture more deeply and truly learn my native language. I want to be able to speak with my elders, understand the deeper meanings in conversations, and honor the beauty and tradition that comes with Yoruba. Even more than that, I want to be able to pass this language on to my future children. I do not want the thread of our heritage to fade with me. I want them to grow up hearing it, speaking it, and feeling proud of where they come from.

"Hello,

Báwo ni, 

One of those challenges people learning Yorùbá face is distinguishing between some particles. 

To them, it sounds the same but sincerely the tones differentiate the way they are used. 

So in this post and few posts, we will be discussing some of these particles. 

Particles in Yorùbá has an inherent meaning and  must be associated with another word to make meaning. 

So, today, we have 

TÍ (With the high tone) - - - that, who. (relative marker)

1.Aṣọ tí mo rà - - - the cloth that I bought. 

2. Oúnjẹ tí mo ṣè---The food that I cooked. 

3. Bàtà tí mo fọ̀-----the shoe that I washed. 

4. Ọkùnrin tí mo rí lánàá - - - The man that I saw yesterday. 

TI (With the flat tone). - - have /has (present perfect Tense). 

5. Mo ti jẹun - - - - I have eaten. 

6. A ti lọ - - - - - - - We have gone. 

7. Wọ́n tí sùn - - - - - They 've slept. 

So, don't forget: Tí - - that or who and Ti (have/has.

"Ashé a todos. Solo quería compartir esto con esta comunidad porque, sinceramente, no estoy segura si deveria recibir mi Mano de Orula.

Así que un poco de contexto. Hace aproximadamente ocho meses recibí mis Guerreros con un santero que también es palero. Antes de recibirlos, me hice una consulta con él, y me dijo que, según lo que salió, yo debía consultarme antes de someterme a cualquier cirugía en el futuro. En ese momento, yo estaba considerando hacerme una cirugía estética, cosa que él no sabía.

Después de esa consulta, resultó que quedé embarazada, y actualmente sigo embarazada. Siempre me quedó muy presente lo que él me dijo: que antes de cualquier cirugía debía hacerme una consulta.

Por motivos de trabajo tuve que mudarme de estado, así que ya no vivo donde estaba antes. Al llegar a mi nuevo estado, contacté a un babalao para hacerme una nueva consulta. Él no sabía nada sobre mí, más allá de mi nombre, y hoy mismo me hizo la consulta. Él sabía que yo estaba embarazada, pero no que mi parto sería por cesárea.

En la consulta, salió que debía recibir Mano de Orula, porque debía tener mucho cuidado con cualquier cirugía o situación que me llevara a un quirófano. Me quedé impactada porque fue exactamente lo mismo que me salió en la consulta anterior.

Él me explicó que, si no recibía Mano de Orula, podría haber complicaciones, como que mi presión arterial se elevara peligrosamente. Me dijo que en la consulta se vio la presencia de un muerto (espíritu) queriendo intervenir de alguna forma negativa. No entendí del todo, pero me dio a entender que podría incluso haber riesgo de muerte durante mi cirugía.

Esto me asustó mucho. Hablé con mi esposo y, aunque ambos tenemos nuestros Guerreros, el santero que nos los entregó nos dejó sin guía. No nos enseñó nada sobre la religión, y somos completamente nuevos en esto.

La verdad, no sé qué hacer. Mi cesárea está programada para el 17 de junio, y ya falta muy poco. El babalao que me hizo la consulta vive en Florida y yo en otro estado, a unas 15 horas de distancia. Me dijo que sí o sí debo recibir Mano de Orula antes de la cirugía, pero no sé qué tan cierto sea todo esto, ya que aún soy bastante ignorante en la religión.

También me dijo algo que me dejó pensativa, porque en la consulta con el santero anterior también me había salido que debía tener mucho cuidado con accidentes automovilísticos. Y en esta nueva consulta volvió a salir lo mismo. Así que hay cosas que coinciden y eso me genera aún más confusión.

Yo consulté al babalao precisamente porque sabía que debía hacerlo antes de cualquier cirugía. Pero ahora no sé si realmente debo recibir Mano de Orula antes de que nazca mi bebé. Además, él me dijo que después del nacimiento, debía llevar al bebé para presentárselo a Orula.

Como mencioné antes, soy nueva en esta religión, y recibir una noticia así, tan fuerte y con una fecha tan cercana al parto —cuando ya tendría 37 semanas— me dejó muy confundida. No sé qué hacer. Necesito un consejo, porque sinceramente estoy muy perdida.",es,1.0

Hello,

Báwo ni, 

How are you doing today and how has the learning been.

We use have/has/had to show :

1. Possession of things. 
2. Present perfect Tense marker. 

Possession of things. - -"" Ní""

Whenever we want to say we own or posses certain things. We use have/has as ""ní"".

Mo ní bàtà méjì - - - - I have two shoes. 
Adé ni aṣọ mẹ́ta - - - Ade has three clothes. 
Ọ̀rẹ́ mi ní ilé kan----My friend has a house.

""tí"" is has/have to show a completed action. 

Mo ti jẹun - - I have eaten. 
Adé tí lọ - - - Ade has gone. 
A ti se oúnjẹ - - We have cooked food.

Lò - - It can be used as a main verb, while

Fi - - It doesn't function as a main verb., the action and whatever you are using to carry it needs to be specified. 

Let's look at some examples.

FI. 

Mò ń fi síbi jẹun - - - I am using spoon to eat. 

Adé ń fi ọṣẹ wẹ̀. - - - - Ade Is using soap to bath. 

Ìyá fi ìkòkò ṣe ọbẹ̀ - - - Mother used pot to cook. soup. 

LÒ.

Mo ń lo síbí---I am using spoon. 

Ó ń lo ọ̀sẹ̀ - - - He/She is using soap. 

Or We could say. 

Mo ń lo ṣíbí láti jẹun. - - - I am using spoon to eat.

"Hello, 

Báwo ni,

For those meeting me here for the first, 

My name is Adéọlá and what I do is to simplify Yorùbá teaching here for every one learning or interested in learning. 

Today, let's learn some tips to help while learning Yorùbá. 

1. Yorùbá is a tonal language, get ready to raise, lower or flatten your voice while distinguishing between words that are written the same way but changes in meaning due to changes in tones. 



2. We don't mark Tense :past form in English, for example, eat - - ate. Our verbs are the same in the present and past form, We indicate the past form  most times through the time of the action. 



3. Emphasis is placed on respect. So we have certain set of pronouns we use while speaking to an older person, in polite conversation with someone or when speaking to a group of people 


We still have more. 


Do you understand?

So, are you interested in learning a new language this year and you are thinking of where to start. 

Relax, let's learn some tips.,

1. Start somewhere: you can read about the  language, watch some YouTube videos. 

2. Give it time: learning a new language just like every other skills takes time, so be patient with yourself. 

3. Be consistent : Don't start and stop half way, the more you learn, the more you get better. 

4. Practice: If possible, get someone to practice with, of course they will laugh 
Or make jest, don't worry, you are getting better. 

5. Get a tutor : Getting a tutor will help because he/she will enhance your consistency and you will learn the rules that governs sentence formation, also you will be accountable because you are paying for the service rendered.

"Hello everyone,

My name is Raphael Olafunbi Alegbeleye, I am a type designer at [ColumnType]( For the past three years, I’ve been developing this script project with a focus on the Yorùbá language, it's called Kikọ which means ""writing"" in Yorùbá. I’m sharing it here in the hope of connecting with people who may find it interesting or useful as their preferred way for writing Yorùbá.

You can read more about the project on the [website]( (although beware, script content hasn't been updated to reflect recent changes). My goal was to create a script that is both beautiful and functional—capturing tonality without overwhelming the page with anchored marks, which can disrupt texture.

The first word ""**Onijere**"" I've seen in many forums already. Its possible meanings are: evil cockroach, traitor, deceiver, a wish to be unsuccessful.  
  
The second word ""**Onisorire**"" I've seen a couple times but some of the meanings are conflicting. I've seen it could mean: wishing someone to be unfortunate, an apology, ChatGPT says ""someone who does good or is a benefactor"" however that seems completely wrong to me given the context.

  
The third word ""**Ayeramabajeni**"" I have not been able to find anywhere. I am very positive I spelled this correctly but the scammer deleted all of their messages and blocked me (lol) so I cannot verify. I'm assuming this word is in the same language but I have no clue.",en,1.0

"Note this tone while learning Yorùbá..

Hello, Báwo ni.

Hope the learning is going well.

As we all know,  learning Yorùbá tones is very important if we don't want our meaning to be misinterpreted.

Let's look at ""Mo"" 

Mo - - - - ""I"" (flat tone) changes to Mò (do, low tone) when it is used with the continuous form of the verb. 


Mo fẹ́ jẹun - - - I want to eat. 
Mò ń jẹun - - - - - I am eating. 

So let's look at  the this word ""Wọn""

Wọ́n (with ""mi"" high tone)  - - - Used for He/She (older). And also for they..

Wọ́n wà ní lé mi lánàá. 

Wọn (with ""re"" mid tone) - - - This is used when you are  constructing sentence in the Negative for  he/she (older) or they.

Wọn - - - This also mean him/her/them.

Wọn ò fẹ́ jẹun - - - He/She /they don't want to eat.

1. ÈGBO:  This food is made from dry corn which is cooked until it is very soft. It is eaten alongside beans and sauce. It is common among the Ìbàdàn people.

2. ÀBÀRÍ /SAPALA: Do you know móí móí? Sapala or àbárì by the Èkìtì people is made just like móí móí. The difference is that móí móí is made from beans, while àbárì from corn.

3 ÒGÌ/ÀKÀMÙ: It is a fermented cereal made from corn. It is similar to custard. The grains are soaked in water for up to 3 days before grinding and then sieve to remove the husk. It goes well with milk and sugar.

4. Ẹ̀KỌ: Ẹ̀kọ is made from Ògì, Ògì is thoroughly cooked, when it is cold it solidifies and we have our ẹ̀kọ. It is eaten with different food like móí móí, àkàrà.

5. ÀDÀLÙ : This is my favorite of the food from corn. Smiles. It is a corn and beans porridge. The corn and beans are cooked together and it gives a delicious taste rather than eating beans porridge alone.

6. KÓKÓRÓ : This is a snack made from a paste of maize flour mixed with sugar and deep friend.

7. BOILED CORN (Àgbàdo sísè)

8. ROASTES CORN (Àgbàdo sísun).

"Hello,

How are you doing today, how has the learning been,

Today let's shift from grammar and talk about the Naming ceremony in Yorùbá culture.

In Yorùbá, name is very important as it is believed that a child lives according to the name he or she bears, thus there are several factors that influence the name given to a child which could be attributed to family tradition, history, religion, or other circumstances surrounding birth.

A child from a royal lineage will have ""Adé"" in the name given, ""ifá, Ọ̀ṣun will be attached to the name of the child from such background and others.

During the Naming ceremony, different items are brought together which can be used to pray for the child. The item are taken one after the one while praying for the new born. 

Amongst them are.

1. KOLANUT (Obì) - - - To ward off evil. 

2. BITTER KOLA (Orógbó) - - Longevity 

3. SUGARCANE (Ìrèké) - - - - Sweetness in life. 

4. WATER (Omi) - - - - water does not have enemy, so the child won't have enemy in life. 

5. MONEY (owó) - - - The child will be wealthy.

"How to use ""That"" in statement..

Hello, how are you doing today and how has the learning been.

Let's talk about  using ""that"" in statement.

""That"" is used to modify the verb or noun that comes before it.

When ""that"" is used to refer back to a noun, we use that as ""tí""

And when "" that"" is used to modify a verb, we use that as ""pé"".

Let's look at some examples,
 Using that as ""Ti"". 
1. The cloth that I boight--- Aṣọ tí mo rà
2. I have the shoes that we bought - - - Mo ní bàtà tí a rà , 
3. He washed the cloth that was dirty - - Ó fọ aṣọ tí ó dọ̀tí

Using that as ""Pé""

I said that I will call you. - Mo ṣọ pé, mo máa pè ẹ́. 

I said that I will buy the cloth - Mo sọ pé mo máa rà aṣọ.

"Vowel deletion in Yorùbá.

Hello,

Báwo ni,

Hope the learning is going well.

Let's discuss Vowel deletion today.

It is  very common for Yorùbá speakers to drop a vowel when they are speaking, especially when they are asking Questions.

Most times, you hear

Kí lórúkọ ẹ - - - What is your name? 

Kí l'o fẹ́ jẹ - - - - - what do you want to eat? 

Níbo lò wà. - - - Where are you?

Níbo lẹ̀ ń gbé - - - Where are you living?

Let's expand it.

1. ""Kí l'órúkọ ẹ"" is"" 

kí ni orúkọ ẹ "" the"" kí ni"" is what 

2. Kí l'o fẹ́ jẹ - - - Kí ni o fẹ́ jẹ. 

3. Níbo ló wà---Níbo ni ó wà - - Where is he/she? 

4. Níbo lẹ̀ ń gbé - - Níbo ni ẹ̀ ń gbé. 

The ""ni"" after the question markers always change to ""L"" when it comes before words that start with  vowels O, Ọ, E, Ẹ and A.  Hence we have it as 

Kí l'o for Kí ni o. 

When it comes before words that start with Vowel ""I"" or consonant, it doesn't change to ""L"" 

Níbo ni ìwé mi wà - - Where is my book? 

Níbo ni bàtà mi wà - - - Where is my shoe?

"Honorific in Yorùbá

Hello,.

Báwo ni,

Today, let's talk about one of the important thing you need to know if you are learning Yorùbá, and that is the use of the Honorific pronoun.

Honorific pronouns are respectful pronouns, Yorùbá does not indicate gender but we place emphasis on respect and this is where we make use of the Honorific pronoun. This is used when we are speaking to either an older person, plural or in polite conversation or formal conversation with someone. 

We have four of them

1. Ẹ - you (all). It is used with greetings, question markers and it is placed in the  subject position, it comes before the verb. 

2. YÍN - YOU. (all). - It is used for possessive, it is placed in the object position after the verb. 

3. Wọ́n (with the high tone ""mí""). - He/she/they

4. Wọn (with the flat tone ""re"").   Him/her/them

Let's look at some examples.

1. Ẹ káàrọ̀ - Good morning
2. Ṣé ẹ fẹ́ jẹun - Do you want to eat?.
3. Mo fún yín ní owó - I gave you money.
4. Mo rí yín lánàá - I saw you yesterday.
5. Wọ́n fẹ́ jẹun - He/she wants to eat.
6. Mo fún wọn ní bàtà - - I gave him shoe.

Note that the pronouns can also be used in plural form and in polite conversation with someone and not necessarily an older person.

"Greetings is one of the most important aspect of Yorùbá culture. I know you are familiar with ""Ẹ káàárọ̀, Ẹ kásàn and other basic greetings, but do you know how to express the greetings conversation fully.

Greetings is conversational, you ought to also respond to the greetings. In Yorùbá, we have some basic words we use for greetings like"" Ẹ kúu, kú, ṣé, báwo, ńkọ́.

Let's analyze them.

1. Ẹ KÚU /KÚ. 
""Ẹ kúu"" is used to greet someone older, group of people and sign of respect even while greeting someone's age of group. This is what is used for most of the greetings. We can use ""Ẹ kaa with"" àárọ̀ (morning) , ọ̀sán (afternoon) , àbọ̀ (return).

Example.
A. Ẹ kúu iṣẹ́ - - - - - - Well done.
B. Ẹ kúu oríire - - - - congratulations.
C. Kú ọjọ́ mẹ́ta - - - - This is used to greet someone you have not seen in a while.

2. ṢÉ 
This could mean hope you , have you, will you depending on the content. But in greeting context, it mean ""hope you are""

Example.

1. Ṣé dáadáa ni--------hope you are fine
Response: dáadáa ni/àlàáfíà ni---I am fine or at peace.
2. Ṣé dáadáa lo wà - - - still hope you are fine.
Response :dáadáa ní mo wà. - - I am fine.

To an older person you would say.
Ṣé dáadáa lẹ wà.

3. BÁWO 
This is ""how"" in Yorùbá and it is also used for greeting.
Example.

1. Báwo ni - - - - How are you.
2. Báwo ni nǹkan - - - How are things.
3. Báwo ni ilé - - - - - - - - How is family.
4. Báwo ni iṣẹ́ - - - - - - How is work.
Response could also range from
Dáadáa ní, àlàáfíà ni, ilé wà dáadáa (the family is fine). Iṣẹ́ ń lọ dáadáa (work is going fine).

4. Ń KỌ́.
 This could mean ""how is"", how about"" where is"" depending on the context..
Examples.

1. Ilé ńkọ́---------How is the family.
2. Iṣẹ́ ńkọ́---------How is work.
3. Àwọn ọmọ ǹkọ́ - - - - - How are the children.
The response could mean the same as above.

Note: The greeting does not have to be specifically with one word, you can mix different words...

For example, we can say : Báwo ni, ṣé dáadáa ní, ilé ńkọ́.

Hello,

Today, let's learn how to ask someone their names, names of things, and others. 

Perhaps you are meeting your Yorùbá friend and you want to know their names  or ask for names of things. 

So let's go. 

""Orúkọ"" is name.

What is your name-----Kí ni orúkọ r(ẹ) - - younger person 
Kí ni orúkọ yín - - older person or group of people (plural), 

The ""rẹ and yín means"" your "" in that expression 

Let's imagine you want to ask for the name of someone's friend. 

You just add friend"" ọ̀rẹ́ before ""rẹ or Ẹ and yín. 

Kí ni orúkọ ọ̀rẹ́ ẹ? 

Kí ni orúkọ ọ̀rẹ́ yín?  What is the name of your friend.

Kí ni orúkọ fóònù ẹ/yín ? - - - what is the name of your phone? 

And this is what you used whenever you want to ask for name of someone or something generally. 

Then for the response. 

Start with 

Orúkọ (Noun or pronoun) ni-----

Orúkọ mi ni - - - Adéọlá. 

The name of my friend is---

Orúkọ́ Ọ̀rẹ́ mi ní Tọ́lá.  "" Ọ̀rẹ́ mi"" is my friend.
