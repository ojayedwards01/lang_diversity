"Hello everybody So I am 27yo and from Scotland in the UK. I want to do a masters degree at a university in Africa and I heard that Kigali is the safest city in Africa. So I have decided to book a holiday to Kigali later this year... for a month, just to see what it is like living there. I think that is a bit much too much time... is the cost of living cheap in Kigali? Because I dont think I have put enough thought into booking this holiday... but I have just booked it. I cant change it now. Ive read on this forum that there isnt anything to do in Kigali, is that correct? And that people speak Kinyarwandan and not English? I dont think I can learn an entire language in a few months... What is Kigali like? Are people nice to foreigners? Is it true there is no crime? I am not worried, I just dont want to be hassled all the time. Does nobody speak English? I heard English was the official language, and Rwanda is part of the British Commonwealth, so I thought it would be fine. Should I just go to Kampala now instead, and just spend a week in Kigali or something? I really wanted Kigali to be the one I liked, but I heard Kampalans speak more English. Thank you.",kin,0.900299608707428

"Spent 7 days in Rwanda as a solo female traveler and had an amazing time! After reflecting on my observations, I have the following questions for locals Things I Smelled 1. I was surprised by the smoke smell in Kigali and Musanze in the middle of July. Is the smoke smell less strong in the winter time? Which months does it get better? 2. Body odor: deodorant seems to be sold in grocery stores but from walking past people on the street, it doesnt seem to be widely used. I wonder, do locals also notice the smell of body odor? What is the general perception of body odor and perfumescologne? Coming from the US, I have experienced the opposite where people like to heavily spray perfumescologne to the point where the perfume smell can be overwhelming. Things I Saw 1. In Kimihurura Roundabout Park late at night, are there foxes or fox like animals? I saw a four legged animal from the back but the tail seemed too bushy to be a dog or cat? 2. From walking in Kigali, I saw a lot of young kidstoddlers with parents but never saw kids throwing tantrumscrycomplain. This is a stark contrast to what I observe in NYC where on the subway, often times kids will throw tantrumswhine to parents. How do parents teach young kids to be so well behaved? 3. This relates to question 2 but how is everyone raised to be so calm? Is this specific to Rwanda or does this calmness trait apply to people of neighboring countries as well? Are people secretly anxious or worried about things but just do a great job of masking it in the facial expressions? I dont think I ever saw any moto taxi driver get angry or raise their voice even when cars are cutting them off. This level of calmness was the biggest culture shock to witness coming from NYC where I see different personalities and a lot of people expressing their emotions. In Rwanda, I found myself speaking more softly and quietly to mirror the cultural norm. Other Questions 1. For Rwandans who have traveled outside the country, what was the biggest surprise to you and where did you visit? 2. I personally did not bargain with moto drivers, do locals in Kigali bargain with moto drivers on the price of their ride?",kin,0.9463518857955933

"Its now 7 PM Im in the middle of Nyungwe, and I have done no activities in the park, not even a small hike. I have been here for 8 hours doing nothing. TL;DR at the bottom. We booked a Nyungwe trip with Milimount Tours and paid in full on Monday. They told us to catch a 4 AM bus from Kigali today (Saturday), which we did. After a 6-hour ride, we arrived at Nyungwe National Park around 10 AM. To our surprise, there were hundreds of people waiting for the zipline, but only 24 harnesses were available. After each group finishes the ride, porters have to hike 5km round trip to bring the harnesses back. This causes a 2 hour delay between groups. On top of that, if it rains, the zipline shuts down. With this setup, only 34 small groups (under 100 people total) can ride the zipline per day. We were supposed to do 3 zipline rides, a canopy walk, and a tea plantation visit but we ended up doing none of it. After sitting in Nyungwe for 8 hours, the tour company gave us two bad options: 1. Do one zipline ride (not guaranteed) and get no refund. 2. Do nothing and get a refund. Poor planning and communication from both Milimount Tours and Nyungwe Park made this an incredibly frustrating waste of a day. If youve got a bigger platform on Twitter or Instagram, feel free to repost we just want the message to reach the right people. Update: We got a 20k refund which is not even half of what we paid for the trip, 65k TL;DR: Paid for full Nyungwe tour package with 3 zipline rides, canopy walk, and tea plantation. After a 6-hour trip, I waited 8 hours and did nothing due to massive overbooking, slow zipline logistics, and poor communication. The tour company offered either a 1 zipline ride (no refund) or a full refund (no activities). The whole day was wasted.",wol,0.2006213515996933

"Why is Rwandair getting such bad notoriety with lost baggage? We flew from Dubai to Ghana and none of our bags came. Every one from Dubai to Ghana did not get a single bag. And we get comments that if we fly Rwandair we should not expect to get our bags. They are going to loose business. Unfortunately there were several travel agents on that flight! Update: the bags finally came in. It took four days to get them. I stayed in town all day but I did not get a call from lost luggage I kept checking the arrival board the flight was supposed to get in at 12:30 but as of 2:30 there was still no update so I went home around 5:30 I got the call that the bags are in so I had to get the passports and tags and went straight into traffic to the airport. Got the bags with some attitude from the lost baggage department but I was unfazed then customs also wanted to check the bags but I left the keys behind I gave her permission and she broke into each bag in less than 30 seconds with just a pen (I think I get why people wrap their bags now) Anyway we get home and the cheese, butter and chocolate have all melted in one suitcase and so thats an almost write off if laundry does not work and it does not look like it.

Kagame has again disappeared from life for 15 days straight.

Social media is full of rumours of insider fighting within his own party. This also comes at a time when Rwanda is increasingly isolated internationally due its support of M23.

"How much does it cost the national money printer to make each of the current banknotes? If it costs more than theyre worth, perhaps its time to make them into coins (if itll be cheaper to mint them) and introduce bigger bills. So why arent there 10k (7.07), 20k (14.13), 50k (35.33) and 100k (70.37) RWF notes? Why stop at only 5k? Hopefully it will be easy to wire-transfer my American money to a Rwandan Bank if I make it to Rwanda before World War III hits the first world. Because once the nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles hit, I have reason to believe that I will no longer be able to access my money Stateside remotely.

"Honestly, Rwanda is really my favorite country in Africa right now. especially given how it grew and how peaceful and safe it got within the past 30 years after experiencing the most horrific event known to man. But I know tribal identities have been demolished and outlawed but I dont know how enforced it is and if relationships between Tutsis and Hutus improved. I know these terms are arbitrary so I apologize if my mention is rude but my questions are 1) Do people still identify differences in ethnicities despite the outlaw or are ethinic identities rendered ineffective ? 2) how common is intermarriage in between Hutus and Tutsis ? 3) Did people (mainly descendants of survivors) heal from the outcome of the past genocide ? Or do resentments and hate still exists ? 4) Are discriminations still in any way present ? 5) what do you guys believe is the best way to breed understanding and alliances post ethnic conflict ?

It was the best thing I did in Rwanda. Reasons to give it a try: 1. That money actually goes to the local community instead of hotel conglomerates 2. The most beautiful part of Rwanda are the incredible villages scattered everywhere. Plus, interacting with local Rwandans around the Twin Lakes is amazing! They rarely see foreigners. 3. Way more authentic experience. If taking hotel boats, you might as well be anywhere else in the world.

"Hi everyone, Im hoping to get some guidance on a situation Im dealing with in Rwanda. My father passed away recently in Rwanda while receiving treatment at a hospital. There was an outstanding hospital bill, and a local law firm offered to help us so we could pay the bill using funds from my fathers bank account there. The lawyers offered to help by contacting the bank and hospital, gathering the necessary documents, and drafting a letter to the bank requesting they release the payment to the hospital. I provided them with documents like my passport, birth certificate, my fathers will, and ID for my siblings. They carried out the task, and the bank paid the hospital directly. Initially the solicitor had a verbal agreement with my late fathers ex-bossfriend (who is local) that he would pick up the bill. However, for some unknown they didnt bill him for this. Now ive come to Rwanda to sort some things out, its been 4 months later and they have sent me a letter demanding 3,000taxes USD in legal fees. This was the first time any fee was mentionedthere was no prior agreement, no engagement letter, and no quote. I feel taken advantage of, especially as I was grieving, overseas, and unfamiliar with the local legal system. Ive asked for a breakdown and plan to dispute the fee. Ive also contacted a UK solicitor for advice. To complicate things, I believe one of the lawyers may have held a senior position in the Rwanda Bar Association. My only other option is to contact the British Embassy as a UK citizen? Has anyone experienced anything similar, or can offer advice on how to handle this kind of situation?

Thank you!! __________________ - So on the official websites the visa is described as follows: V12 Reciprocity: Long term visitor visa is issued on a reciprocal basis to a foreigner who visits Rwanda for visit, conference or any reason other than work purpose. Would multiple shorter trips over several years qualify me for this visa or is it only intended for people staying over 90 days? - Ive seen it listed that the visa is only being given out to US citizens, but this info potentially seems outdated.

"I often hear from Rwandans that there is no proof that the RDF is in Congo, that the conflict in Congo has nothing to do with Rwanda, and I wanted to know if Rwandan civilians are actually made to ignore UN reports that directly prove the Rwandan armys presence in DRC. Do Rwandan civilians actually believe their government over independent, third party, UN reports? Do Rwandans really believe that everyone is lying except for their government? Every single year since 2004 the United Nations writes reports on the state of the DRC conflict using neutral investigators with no connection to any parties (the 2021 report, for example, was investigated by independent experts from Kenya, France, Colombia, Benin, Belgium, and the UK nobody from DRC or Rwanda itself), and the most recent reports include the following: 40. The Group obtained further evidence - authenticated photographs, drone footage, video recordings, testimony and intelligence - confirming systematic border incursions by RDF and its reinforced presence in Petit Nord, with RDF matching, if not surpassing, M23 in numbers (see paras. 37 and 43). RDF positioned itself at the frontlines, operated high-tech weaponry and directly engaged in combat. Its presence was critical in repelling joint FARDC-Wazalendo offensives and occupying new territories in Petit Nord (see annex 27). 41. In January 2024, at least 1,000 RDF troops entered the Democratic Republic of the Congo through various border crossings east of Kibumba, Rutshuru territory, and were deployed to key military positions. Following this reinforcement, on 3 February, RDF and M23 took control of Shasha, a village with strategic access to Lake Kivu. RDF maintained combat positions on the hills around Sake, which it still occupied at the time of drafting. In early April 2023, RDF took control of three vacated MONUSCO positions north-west of Sake (see annex 28). At the time of drafting, 500 RDF and 500 M23 combatants, the latter commanded by the sanctioned individuals Baudoin Ngaguye (CDi.019) and Bernard Byamungu (CDi.038) and Julien Mahano Baratuje, controlled the areas north, west and south of Sake.

"So, many people probably use the Facebook marketplace to buy things or at least explore the prices and other information on things they want or might want to buy. If you check carefully there are so many duplicate listings with prices being so much different. By same listings, I mean the same pictures being copied from original listings or probably real. Say something cost 1M RWF (listed by a legit seller) A scammer will list the same thing (copy pictures and descriptions) for 500K RWF. If you see two things with one costing less, its easy to say the price is a factor, and you are very likely to engage in conversation with the listing with the lower price. You chat and bring down the prices from 500K to 350k and agree on getting the item. The scammer likely will ask you for location and when you say in Kigali and ask where they are based, they will say like in Nyamata somewhere (it is an example). But here is the thing they are scammers and claim they do free delivery anywhere in Kigali (thats the catch). You are probably left with two options: 1. Chat about how they can deliver 2. Ask them the exact address and come pick them up. If you go with option 1, they will insist that you pay half the price and pay the rest after deliver. Ask you may guess, whatever you pay there you are ripped off. They were never real in the first place. If you choose option 2. They will keep insisting on delivery and if you dont agree they cut the connection or ignore your calls or messages since they have no other means of getting your money. This is a real observation of someone who regularly buys on the Facebook marketplace. That is just one way but there are so many ways they do it. What can you do in those situations?! Maybe: - Always demand to get their exact address so you can check the items. - Or ask for payment on delivery. I mean pay 100 only when you receive the items. Or just buy from known shops, and sellers. Just be aware there are a lot of scams happening there and be vigilant. Disclaimer: Not all listings are scams and a listing being cheap doesnt mean its a scam. There are many honest and legit sellers on Facebook Marketplace. This post is just a heads-up based on common patterns Ive noticed.",kin,0.2562524676322937

"Hey everyone, I see a lot of travelers asking about car rentals in Kigali, so I thought Id share some local advice. Im based here and run a small rental company, so hopefully this helps! - Driving in Kigali is pretty smooth roads are in good condition, and people are generally respectful drivers. Just be ready for lots of motorbikes and hidden speed bumps! - Insurance is really important. Even if youre a careful driver, unexpected things can happen, so make sure youre fully covered. - Self-drive or driver? If youre new to Africa, sometimes having a local driver (even just for the first day) makes things way easier. After that, self-driving is fine!

Do you guys know how much Rwanda is making and has made so far from the VISIT RWANDA marketing campaign? It must be making your country a lot money or social capital or both if you are sponsoring more and more clubs every year. I have just learnt that Atletico Madrid has joined the fold. Has Rwanda gotten more foreign investments or more tourists as a result of the campaign? Maybe more African countries should study the pros and cons of such a venture.,kin,0.9865126609802246

"Im Kenyan-Rwandan, proud of how far weve comebut Im also deeply concerned. Its 2025, and despite the flashy Kigali skyline and all the international praise we get, we are still heavily dependent on foreign aid. Some reports say nearly 40 of our national budget comes from donors. Isnt it time we questioned this model? Wheres the real economic independence? Were building convention centers and smart cities, but most rural areas still lack proper access to healthcare, quality education, or electricity. The leadership boasts about being self-reliant, but how self-reliant can we be when a cut in donor funding could crash entire programs? I get that aid helped us recover post-genocide, but are we using it as a crutch now? Why arent we investing more in agriculture, small industries, and local innovation instead of relying on foreign-funded NGOs to do basic development work?

"I was born after the Genocide, so I never fully understood how much it affected people. I was having a small row with my parent, and after a very long and deep conversation, I realized shes still living in survival mode. All of her decisions and relationships are influenced by what happened to her during that period. Her family left her during the Genocide, and she had to fend for herself. While she wont admit it publicly, shes still very much afraid that it could happen again, no matter how many people surround her. This is where it gets even more dangerous, because like a domino effect, parents (unwillingly) transfer that trauma to their children, which to some extent impacts their lives and starts a vicious cycle.",kin,0.45472532510757446

"Moses Turahirwa: The Story of the Most Ungrateful Rwandan of His Time Theres hardly a need to explain who Moses Turahirwa isor to introduce his brand, Moshions. Many of us have worn it, or at least admired it. Personally, I only own one shirt from the label. But lets be honestMoshions wasnt just a fashion brand; it became a cultural symbol. It took off in a way few Rwandan brands ever have, gracing the wardrobes of none other than the President of Rwanda, the First Lady, and even the First Daughter. That level of endorsement alone elevated Moshions far beyond what any runway or press release could do. It was a perfect blend: Moses undeniable talent and Rwandas soft power. Together, they propelled him to global heightsheights he could never have reached on his own. Then came the scandal. Moses was arrested and held for 76 days after publicly displaying a fake Rwandan passport, claiming a new identity as a womanallegedly with the blessing of His Excellency, President Paul Kagame. At the time of his arrest, he had over 2 million in legally-earned income. That alone shows just how successful he had become within the very system he now turns his back on. Today, Moses has made it clearhe despises Kagame, the Inkotanyi, and everything they stand for. And he chose cyunamo, a sacred time of national mourning, to make his statement. Thats not activism. Thats provocation. And before you try to spin this as Rwanda being anti-gay, lets cut that nonsense right here. Its not illegal to be gay in Rwanda. Nobody is persecuted for that. Side note: Im flying to Japan in July for a gay weddingthats how little it means to us. No one cares. Its not about who you loveits about how you conduct yourself. Alsolets not forget when your dog was tragically killed. Who stepped in to protect you? The same government you now insult. Be honest with yourself: if they hadnt intervened that day, what do you think wouldve happened? Those guys wouldnt have stopped at your dog. They wouldve broken your neck too.

"So, I reached out with this person 29 years after a close relationship and friendship. This person is a Belgian who lived in my village before 1994. She had a girl of my age and we were very close, she had sleepovers in each-others homes and we basically were inseparable until they left the place shortly before the genocide. Our hearts were broken, we thought we would never hear of each other. In 2009 I moved to Kenya and learned the charity this lady was working for was there. I asked around and finally got in contact with the daughter. It was a happy reunion on the phone until I suggested to meet up. My friend tried to hide it but I finally realized she just didnt want to meet me. First forward, I moved to Canada and on my way from visiting my family in Rwanda I stopped in Netherland and planned to go to Belgium to visit the Mother. I assumed she would be so happy to see me and hear all that happened to us after they left. On the picture is her reply. I didnt think much of it until I talked to my mom and told her what happened and she said, what were you thinking, Belgians who were in Rwanda think Tutsi are the bad people in the whole genocide thing.

I am having a lot of difficulty understanding the whole Banyamulenge and Banyarwanda distinction. From what I have read so far, Banyarwanda seems to refer to all Congolese of Rwandan origin. They speak Kinyarwanda, make up about 50 of the North Kivu population, and are majority Hutu with a sizeable Tutsi minority and a smaller portion of Twa. The Banyamulenge are a sub-group of the Banyarwanda that are of Tutsi origin. They are mostly found in the Mulenge Area of South Kivu and speak Kinyamulenge which is a dialect of Kinyarwanda. As I understand it, the Congolese seem to consider the Banyamulenge as foreigners. Does this also extend to the Banyarwanda or its only the Banyamulenge that are targetted?

"Recent developments in the Congo crisis, including the talks between Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi in Qatar, have led to an agreement on a ceasefire. It is rumored that the leaders of the Alliance of Democratic Forces AFCM23 rebel group may soon meet with President Tshisekedi in Qatar as well. This raises an interesting possibility: what if Rwanda agrees to sever ties with AFCM23, halt all funding, and even withdraw all alleged troops from Congolese territory, but the AFCM23 leadership refuses to stand down? Given that AFCM23 now controls a significant portion of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)an area reportedly twice the size of Rwanda itself and rich in mineral resourcesit is conceivable that they could sustain their operations independently. With so much at stake, it seems unlikely that they would readily surrender, even if Rwanda withdraws its support or the Congolese government offers promises of peace and integration into the national army. Several questions emerge from this scenario. Might AFCM23 demand autonomy for the territory they currently control? If President Tshisekedi urges them to disarm, what incentives could he offer in exchange, especially considering their demonstrated resolve and battlefield successes against his forces? Tshisekedis initial reluctance to negotiate with AFCM23, followed by his recent request for talks, suggests he recognizes their strength and may fear their capabilities. This situation presents no straightforward resolution. Will eastern DRC ultimately gain autonomy, or will AFCM23 yield to diplomatic pressure? The path forward remains uncertain, with significant implications for the regions stability and resource control.",kin,0.6905157566070557

"In a significant shift in policy, President Félix Tshisekedi has agreed to participate in direct peace talks with the M23 rebel group, with Angola mediating the discussions set to commence on March 18 in Luanda, the day of my birthday actually. This development comes as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) announces a phased withdrawal of its troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), raising concerns about the nations capacity to manage rebel threats independently. Simultaneously, reports indicate that the DRC is negotiating a minerals-for-security agreement with the United States, potentially granting American companies exclusive access to critical minerals in exchange for military assistance against the M23 insurgency. These concurrent developments present a complex dilemma for the DRCs future. On one hand, engaging in direct talks with M23 could pave the way for a peaceful resolution to years of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern regions. On the other hand, the withdrawal of SADC forces might leave a security vacuum that could be exploited by various armed groups. Furthermore, while the proposed deal with the U.S. could bolster the DRCs military capabilities, it raises questions about sovereignty and the long-term implications of granting foreign entities significant control over the nations natural resources. As these events unfold, the path ahead for the DRC remains uncertain. The outcomes of the upcoming peace talks and the potential U.S. partnership will undoubtedly have profound impacts on the nations stability and its control over valuable mineral assets. The international community watches closely, hopeful for a resolution that ensures peace, sovereignty, and prosperity for the Congolese people. Especially the Banyamulenge people suffering a lot due to these conflicts. What are your thoughts on President Tshisekedis recent moves? Do you believe these strategies will lead to lasting peace and stability in the DRC, or do they pose risks that could further complicate the nations future?",som,0.984650731086731

"uemmbyiringiro made multiple comments about value adding jobs in Rwanda under [this post]( and I wanted to bring this conversation to the forefront in a new post. One of the reasons most of the products we consume in Rwanda are imported is because of our lack of value adding initiatives. For context, an example of a value adding job is taking crops residue or manure to produce organic fertilizer. This fertilizer can be sold to local farmers or sold abroad to bring in foreign currencies. On the opposite end, a non (or little) value adding activity is being a house broker or buying clothes in Dubai and selling them in Kigali. This type of activity puts a lot of pressure on the Rwandan Franc. The latter requires the Rwandan businessman to take out US Dollars from a local bank, taking that cash to Dubai, bringing those clothes he bought in Dollars to Rwanda and selling them in Rwandan Francs. Question now is how can we get out of this cycle of having everyone venture into this type of activity? How can we as a society or the government encourage people to engage in more value adding activities and businesses?",kin,0.985450267791748

Parts of other nations were stated such as Uganda and Burundi but the Congo portion is the one that resounds strongly given current events. With that being said, would it be possible Kagame is trying to annex either one or both Kivu provinces in the DRC similar to how Russia annexed Crimea under the pretext of protecting an ethnic population (Congolese TutsiBanyamulenge in this case) and eventually paving the way for referendums to join Rwanda?

He insulted me and my siblings with all sorts of disrespectful words. Hes a very loud, disrespectful man. When I finished high school, I was still living with him and my mother. He continued to abuse and insult me, so I had to move in with a high school friend. I lived there for 10 years until I went abroad to study.

Hey, I had a few follow-up questions about Rwanda and would really appreciate any insights. 1. Are political assassinations a reality in Rwanda? For example, André Kagwa Rwiserekas casewas it politically motivated, or is there another explanation? 2. Is Crystal Ventures (formerly Tri-Star Investments) really just a state-controlled investment vehicle, or is there more to the claims that it operates as a political tool? 3.

He used oil wealth to improve the country, pushed for African unity, and didnt bow down to Western powers. But at the same time, he was accused of supporting rebels, being a dictator, and eliminating political opponents. This got me thinking about President Paul Kagame. I admire his stubbornness toward the West he doesnt just do as they say, which I respect. But that also makes me wonder could the same thing happen to him? The West has a history of turning against African leaders who dont follow their agenda. Kagame has made Rwanda stable and developed, but if things ever turned against him, would Rwanda be strong enough to avoid chaos like Libya?

A smartphone factory, a growing fintech sector, and major infrastructure projects like the Kigali Innovation City highlight its ambitions. The country is praised for its governance and investment climate, yet critics point to state control, inequality, and heavy reliance on aid. I read that the reason the west is ignoring rwandas incursion into congo is their guilt of sitting idle during genocide period and because foreign aid actually transforms into actual development on the ground Can people of Rwanda tell me that Is Rwandas growth a true success story driven by strong policies and innovation, or is it partly a result of good branding and external support? What are the key factors behind its rise? TL;DR: Rwanda is growing fast, with industries like smartphone manufacturing and fintech taking off. Is this genuine development or just smart PR?

Let us not just have another meeting like the many we have had. We cant go on forever massaging problems. What is happening there is an ethnic war that has been brewing for a long time, denying peoples rights and then attacking Rwanda. You must recognize peoples rights and take a step and resolve the issue. This war was started by DRC and not anything from Rwanda. It was just brought and put on our shoulders and we were told to own it. We cant own it. There is no question about it. Let us use this meeting in a manner that will put into account all these matters seriously, and find a lasting solution.",som,0.9784811735153198

"Many news outlets covering the conflict in eastern Congo overlook two crucial aspects: (1) the presence of the genocidal FDLR militia and (2) the marginalization of Rwandese Speaking Congolese citizens. The FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) is composed of remnants from the genocidal regime that operated in Rwanda prior to 1994. For nearly three decades, they have been active in eastern Congo, with the stated goal of attacking Rwanda and restoring the pre-1994 government. In recent developments, the FDLR has openly cooperated with the Congolese army and received public support from the Congolese government. (On 2) A significant portion of the population in eastern Congo speaks Kinyarwanda. They have inhabited this region for centuries - which was part of the Rwandan Kingdom. The region was placed within during the colonial partition of Africa. These Kinyarwanda-speaking Congolese have long been marginalized and labeled as Rwandans, often forced to flee. Since 1994, they have been targeted by the FDLR and other militias seeking to drive them out of their ancestral lands to Rwanda. The Congolese government has repeatedly failed to protect them as citizens, and in some instances, has viewed them with suspicion rather than recognizing their legitimate status as Congolese. This may helps understand the position of the East African Community which asks the Congolose government to address those two issues : to dismantle the FDLR militia and to enter in dialogue with M23 to address the second issue.",kin,0.6793913245201111

Im Canadian and a very bad chef, so if anyone can think of a relatively easy dish for a beginner to make, I would be extremely grateful. Thanks!",kin,0.7747933864593506

"Id love recommendations for a reputable company, especially as a woman travelling alone. From what Ive read so far, I do see that there are also treks in Uganda that are less expensive, but the experience seems to be better in Rwanda (likelihood of seeing them up close). Not saying this is 100 the case, but this is what Ive heardread so far. Please let me know if I am wrong! Im primarly interested in seeing gorillas, but if there is a package where you can see gorillas one day and chimpanzees the next, that would be amazing. Ive read of people also doing a safari which I wouldnt mind depending on the cost, but its not a must since Ive done that in Tanzania. I would like to stay somewhere decently nice, but the lodges that have been recommended in other posts are like 2000 USDnight, any recommendations that are closer to like 150-300 USDnight. Open to a lodge or glamping. This is a once in a lifetime trip that I know will be expensive, but Im not a millionare, unfornately. I am looking to go earlymid September if that makes a difference.",swh,0.45563822984695435

"This might not just be an issue concentrated in Rwanda, this could be a continental issue even Asian countries deal with this too. However what I have noticed in Rwanda while visiting, is that white people do sometimes get treated better, even given extra help than other black people or Rwandese people. I know that Rwanda is trying to encouraged more tourists to visit Rwanda, so the impression tourists get of the country and its people is important but that shouldnt mean putting white people on a pedestal either in my opinion. I guess its just disappointing to see. Im Rwandese btw but grew up in the west, so I was always around white people, so I am used to being treated differently because of my race but I dont expect any less from people there. However while Im in Rwanda I thought the last thing I had to think about was being treated differently because of my race as well. Also because there are fewer white people there, it somehow makes it more noticeable when they are given preferential treatment compared to everyone else. Again this is more of an issue in the whole of Africa but I truly hope someday even Rwanda learns to stop treating tourists, foreigners and white people better than their own people.",kin,0.9609399437904358
"[Chinese gets 20 years in prison for beating Rwandese worker]( This just made my day. Its not often an African Country takes a stand and says, no - youre not treating my people like trash. Investor is not getting away with it - he wont buy off the authorities. If were to make Africa a nice place to live in - we need to have some pride. Not be compromised by money. Normally - the culprit gives a bribe to the authorities and victim and it is forgotten, or theyre deported (like the Chinaman who called the president a monkey in Kenya) but not in this case.

"Hello, i will be for work in Kigali, Rwanda in March and will have 4-5 days extra afterwards im planning on taking to explore. My priority are apes. i can see safari in other parts of Africa in the future but i understand that ape trekking is unique to only a handful of countries in Africa. From my research 1 day for gorilla trekking is an option (in volcano NP), chimps require 2 days minimum (in Nyungwe park) and safari is whenever in Akagara (no requirements). If i do 2 days chips - going to volcano NP via lake Kivu for 1 day with gorillas and then one day i akagara (via Kigali) - is anything wrong with that itinirary?",kin,0.8361818194389343

"Hi everyone! Im hoping to get some guidance about studying in Rwanda for two friends planning their next education steps. Heres the situation: 1. Masters in Architecture One of my friends finished their bachelors degree in architecture in Burundi and now wants to pursue a masters degree in architecture in Rwanda. Are there any universities in Rwanda that offer this program? Whats the application process like, and what are the admission requirements? Do these programs include internships or connections with architecture firms? 2. Veterinary Medicine Studies Another friend of mine completed high school in the DRC and is interested in studying veterinary medicine in Rwanda. Ive heard there might be a short-term training program (around 18 months) in veterinary medicine, but Im not sure if this is true. Can anyone confirm? If that program doesnt exist, are there any universities in Rwanda offering a bachelors degree in veterinary medicine? What are the admission requirements, and how long would the program take? Does the curriculum cover both small and large animals, or is it more specialized? If youve studied in Rwanda or know anyone who has been through these programs, Id love to hear your advice or experiences. Any tips, links, or details would be super helpful! Thanks so much for your help!",kin,0.8987637758255005
