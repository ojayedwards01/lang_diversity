"Hey guys! Ive been thinkingare there any words in Yoruba that dont really have a translation or anything like them in other languages? Like, unique words that really capture something special about the culture or language?

"Hello everyone, Im trying to find the most accurate or culturally appropriate Yoruba phrase for Created in Heaven. Ive been told by my Yoruba-speaking parents that there isnt a direct translation for this phrase because Yoruba is a context-heavy language, and certain concepts like heaven dont always map directly the way they do in English. Still, I want to get as close as possible to the meaning behind Created in Heaven something that captures the idea of divine origin, uniqueness, or being spiritually crafted. As of right now I have this phrase, Àkàndá Olórun (Gods specially made creation) which was given by my parents and Im settling on for now but I would love any other or closer translations for created in heaven.

"In the Yoruba language Lesbian and Gaism mean the samething, and we call this ABOOYW In the Yoruba language Lesbian and Gaism both mean the samething, they fall under the words: Adefuro, Adodi, Ado, and Agbere. All these 4 words start with the letter A. Bisexual is the word use for a human who has sex with both Male and Females and in Yoruba we say, eni ti o ba okunrin ati obinrin lopọ this literally means one who has sex with both man and women the letter denoted for this would be BOOLP which is for ba okunrin ati obinrin lopọ. In Yoruba the words transgender is eni ti o fẹ yi ara rẹ pada this literally means, one who wants to change his or her body the letter denoted for this would be YAP this is Yi ara pada. And in Yoruba the word queer is and easy one to say, wèrè this means one who is crazy or has lost his or her mind. So there you have it, the word LGBTQ in Yoruba is translated as ABOOLPYAPW and because obviously this word is to long and is easy to forget, it should be shortened to ABOOYW. Again the A stand for Adefuro, Adodi, Ado, and Agbere. The B stand for Ba Okunrin ati Obinrin lopọ. The Y stand for yi which can mean to change as in rotate like a circle, which refers to them changing and transitioning from a man to woman or woman to man. And lastly the W stand for wèrè which just means a mentally insane person. So there you have it, LGBTQ in Yoruba is ABOOYW I am not LGBTQ",yor,0.893110454082489

"Hi everyone I (23F) was born and raised in the US, and while my parents mostly spoke English to me growing up, both of my grandmothers spoke Yoruba. Because of that, I have a very basic understanding of the language. I can follow conversations and understand what is being said, but I never really learned how to respond in Yoruba. I always answered in English. Now that I am 23, I feel a strong desire to embrace my culture more deeply and truly learn my native language. I want to be able to speak with my elders, understand the deeper meanings in conversations, and honor the beauty and tradition that comes with Yoruba. Even more than that, I want to be able to pass this language on to my future children. I do not want the thread of our heritage to fade with me. I want them to grow up hearing it, speaking it, and feeling proud of where they come from.

Yorùbá is a tonal language, get ready to raise, lower or flatten your voice while distinguishing between words that are written the same way but changes in meaning due to changes in tones. 2. We dont mark Tense :past form in English, for example, eat - - ate. Our verbs are the same in the present and past form, We indicate the past form most times through the time of the action. 3.

(Elu is a dialectal version of Oluwa) I wanted to know if there was a way I could combine the attributes of these names in Yoruba.",som,0.4919436275959015
"Hello, Báwo ni, Today, lets dive away from Grammar and lets learn Some Yorùbá foods. Todays, lets learn some of the foods we can get from corn. 1. ÈGBO: This food is made from dry corn which is cooked until it is very soft. It is eaten alongside beans and sauce. It is common among the Ìbàdàn people. 2. ÀBÀRÍ SAPALA: Do you know móí móí? Sapala or àbárì by the Èkìtì people is made just like móí móí. The difference is that móí móí is made from beans, while àbárì from corn. 3 ÒGÌÀKÀMÙ: It is a fermented cereal made from corn. It is similar to custard. The grains are soaked in water for up to 3 days before grinding and then sieve to remove the husk. It goes well with milk and sugar. 4. ẸKỌ: Ẹkọ is made from Ògì, Ògì is thoroughly cooked, when it is cold it solidifies and we have our ẹkọ. It is eaten with different food like móí móí, àkàrà. 5. ÀDÀLÙ : This is my favorite of the food from corn. Smiles. It is a corn and beans porridge. The corn and beans are cooked together and it gives a delicious taste rather than eating beans porridge alone. 6.

"Hello, How are you doing today, how has the learning been, Today lets shift from grammar and talk about the Naming ceremony in Yorùbá culture. In Yorùbá, name is very important as it is believed that a child lives according to the name he or she bears, thus there are several factors that influence the name given to a child which could be attributed to family tradition, history, religion, or other circumstances surrounding birth. A child from a royal lineage will have Adé in the name given, ifá, Ọṣun will be attached to the name of the child from such background and others. During the Naming ceremony, different items are brought together which can be used to pray for the child. The item are taken one after the one while praying for the new born. Amongst them are. 1. KOLANUT (Obì) - - - To ward off evil. 2. BITTER KOLA (Orógbó) - - Longevity 3. SUGARCANE (Ìrèké) - - - - Sweetness in life. 4. WATER (Omi) - - - - water does not have enemy, so the child wont have enemy in life. 5. MONEY (owó) - - - The child will be wealthy. Do you have Yorùbá names. I am Adéọlá. Your Yorùbá tutor.

"Vowel deletion in Yorùbá. Hello, Báwo ni, Hope the learning is going well. Lets discuss Vowel deletion today. It is very common for Yorùbá speakers to drop a vowel when they are speaking, especially when they are asking Questions. Most times, you hear Kí lórúkọ ẹ - - - What is your name? Kí lo fẹ jẹ - - - - - what do you want to eat? Níbo lò wà. - - - Where are you? Níbo lẹ ń gbé - - - Where are you living? Lets expand it. 1. Kí lórúkọ ẹ is kí ni orúkọ ẹ the kí ni is what 2. Kí lo fẹ jẹ - - - Kí ni o fẹ jẹ. 3. Níbo ló wà---Níbo ni ó wà - - Where is heshe? 4. Níbo lẹ ń gbé - - Níbo ni ẹ ń gbé. The ni after the question markers always change to L when it comes before words that start with vowels O, Ọ, E, Ẹ and A. Hence we have it as Kí lo for Kí ni o. When it comes before words that start with Vowel I or consonant, it doesnt change to L Níbo ni ìwé mi wà - - Where is my book? Níbo ni bàtà mi wà - - - Where is my shoe?

"Honorific in Yorùbá Hello,. Báwo ni, Today, lets talk about one of the important thing you need to know if you are learning Yorùbá, and that is the use of the Honorific pronoun. Honorific pronouns are respectful pronouns, Yorùbá does not indicate gender but we place emphasis on respect and this is where we make use of the Honorific pronoun. This is used when we are speaking to either an older person, plural or in polite conversation or formal conversation with someone. We have four of them 1. Ẹ - you (all). It is used with greetings, question markers and it is placed in the subject position, it comes before the verb. 2. YÍN - YOU. (all). - It is used for possessive, it is placed in the object position after the verb. 3. Wọn (with the high tone mí). - Heshethey 4. Wọn (with the flat tone re). Himherthem Lets look at some examples. 1. Ẹ káàrọ - Good morning 2. Ṣé ẹ fẹ jẹun - Do you want to eat?. 3. Mo fún yín ní owó - I gave you money. 4. Mo rí yín lánàá - I saw you yesterday. 5. Wọn fẹ jẹun - Heshe wants to eat. 6. Mo fún wọn ní bàtà - - I gave him shoe.

"Hello, how are you doing today, How has the learning been. So lets move away from grammar today and learn something about being fat in Yorùbá . What comes to your mind when you see a man or woman that is fat in Yorùbá, I mean robust, and not obese. So, this is it, according to the Yorùbá people, being fat is a sign of healthy living, living in affluence and having peace of mind. Unlike these days where everyone goes to the gym and no one cares whether you are fat or not. Those days, women that are slim are often advised to eat more to add weight, since people judge because of the outward appearance. Does this applies to this present time. Lets discuss.
