"አማርኛ እንዳረጓት ትሆናለች! (ወደ ብልግና እንዳትወስዱት) In Amharic words are logical and easy to memorize and know the language in shorter time comparing to English where things are not related. For Example, 1. the writing system in English is so awkward, unpredictable and super hard to achieve fluency level in writing unless we use spell checkers or an AI. Even if the letters are 26, the rule is huge. But in Amharic, since Amharic is rich in phonetics, you can write any Amharic word easily and read it easily. 2. The English words are many, but in Amharic words are short and related, lets see some examples words here even if many words are not like this, but its helpful. (You will help me on this) መፅሐፍ - Book ቤተ-መፅሐፍ - Library መፃፊያ - Pen table ፅሑፍ - Writing Article ፅህፈት ቤት - Office ስነ-ፅሁፍ - Literature So, if you know the first word, the will be predictable and easy. But in English, things are not related and predictable. So learning English takes much time than Amharic. Semitic languages are beautiful, logical and easy to learn. In Arabic it is also the same. I am amazed with people who says Amharic is difficult.",amh,0.9900665283203125

"Hi friends! I am trying my best to learn Amharic and wanted feedback on my methods from someone whos learned the language later in life. Ive broken my approach into a few buckets below. Tutoring: I currently have a tutor on Italki that I work with a few times a week. After each session, I create Anki cards for each new vocab words, phrases, or verbs we use in the session. These sessions are a mix of speaking practice and grammar learning in the early stages of the language learning process. Anki: I use Anki to review content that Ive learned and have been creating a mixture of vocab cards, sentence cards, and adding useful phrases over time to slowly learn how to communicate with strangers. Passive learning: Ive heard that watching television is a good way to get language input when you are not operating in the context of the target language youre hoping to learn. Since Im not in Ethiopia, Ive been watching Besintu and other sitcoms to get a feel for how conversations flow. I dont understand most of what is happening but can pick up key words and some verbs and I can feel my brain stretching to create meaning from the show. Altogether, Im really serious about learning the language and want to make sure Im approaching this process in a way that makes sense and maximizing my learning. Any advice or feedback is welcome!",kin,0.5230755805969238

"ሰላም ሰላም ውድ ቤተሰቦች I wanted to inquire about your thoughts on the Amharic translation on ChatGPT. I use the translation of ChatGPT for quite a lot of things. Its excellent for a lot of languages, especially European languages, but also Arabic, Japanese, Turkish and the like. Even the Somali is good. The Amharic translation though is extremely lacking. It is currently slightly better I believe, previously it hallucinated an entire language of its own. Currently though, it somewhat makes sense but it spits a lot of gibberish. I demanded it for an explanation, and it told me its because it wasnt trained on a lot of Amharic material, and I do believe that its a shame. What are your thoughts on this? Do you care?

"If anyones struggling with Amharic grammar, the best resource by far is the Reference Grammar of Amharic written by the late Wolf Leslau. Its a massive book, and I dont think anyone should read this cover to cover, but if you dont understand a specific grammatical construction or concept, this book is absolutely the best and most comprehensive resource. It gives all the verb conjugations, explains complicated (and simple) issues that many people have with Amharic. It also details some outdated and archaic Amharic, so rather than taking what the book says as a prescription, you should use it to understand what other people are saying and the things that you dont understand. It gives tons of examples (a few of which are mistaken, dialectical, or incorrect); however, the vast majority of the time, this book will aid you.

"ሰላም! Ive noticed that double consonants are very frequent in Amharic, despite not being marked in writing. I wondered if you knew where one can conveniently look up the correct pronunciation of a word? Online dictionaries only give incomplete transliteration without double consonants. Google Translate speech synthesator generally pronounces double vowels where they should be, but its often hard to catch with a beginners ear if a consonant is doubled or not. Like, how do I know that there are double consonants in ድመት (dəmmät), ውሻ (wəšša), or ፍየል (fəyyäl), but not in ፈረስ (färäs) or አሳማ (asama)? Dont native speakers themselves get confused and need to look it up? Another issue is whether a consonant is pronounced with the vowel ə or not.

It seems possible that medieval or early Amharic retained these sound distinctions, which became less distinct over time. I wonder if this shift was influenced by differences between the Amharic spoken by the nobility and that spoken by the general population, or possibly the result of Cushitic language features becoming more pronounced as Amharic developed (unlike Tigrinya which remained relatively isolated).

"Just to give some context, I wanted to kind of explain the situation I have on hand. A good friend of mine was adopted from Ethiopia when he was 13- his birth mom passed away and he was subsequently adopted by an American family alongside his biological younger sister. A few weeks ago, his younger sister passed away in a truly tragic and sudden manner. So, now along side the loss itself, being left in a situation at which he no longer has any remaining blood family members has obviously taken a really big toll on him. Additionally, since hed been adopted at 13, after spending a decent amount of time in the orphanage- his ability to speak or understand Amharic is essentially gone. Hes allowing me to design a memorial tattoo for him and Im really wanting to find the best way to communicate the concept Im going for. I know most things are context related and Im not going to get anywhere with some translating software or something. So, anyway.

Something to reflect the idea that, just because they arent physically here with him doesnt mean that their memoryspiritlovesouls have vanished. Some like philosophical reassurance or comforting- even if its like something like our souls are tied, just something neutral or positive, rather than saying something like I am never going to be whole without you.
