"Amharic is easy, concise and Flexible, not unpredictable as English","# አማርኛ እንዳረጓት ትሆናለች! (ወደ ብልግና እንዳትወስዱት)

In Amharic words are logical and easy to memorize and know the language in shorter time comparing to English where things are not related. For Example,

1. the writing system in English is so awkward, unpredictable and super hard to achieve fluency level in writing unless we use spell checkers or an AI. Even if the letters are 26, the rule is huge.

But in Amharic, since Amharic is rich in phonetics, you can write any Amharic word easily and read it easily.

2. The English words are many, but in Amharic words are short and related, lets see some examples words here even if many words are not like this, but it's helpful. (You will help me on this)

* **መፅሐፍ - Book**
* **ቤተ-መፅሐፍ - Library**
* **መፃፊያ - Pen / table**
* **ፅሑፍ - Writing / Article**
* **ፅህፈት ቤት - Office**
* **ስነ-ፅሁፍ - Literature**

So, if you know the first word, the will be predictable and easy. But in English, things are not related and predictable. So learning English takes much time than Amharic. Semitic languages are beautiful, logical and easy to learn. In Arabic it is also the same. I am amazed with people who says Amharic is difficult.",2025-08-10 05:54:38

Learning Amharic and want feedback on approach,"Hi friends! I am trying my best to learn Amharic and wanted feedback on my methods from someone who’s learned the language later in life. 

I’ve broken my approach into a few buckets below. 

Tutoring: 
I currently have a tutor on Italki that I work with a few times a week. After each session, I create Anki cards for each new vocab words, phrases, or verbs we use in the session. These sessions are a mix of speaking practice and grammar learning in the early stages of the language learning process. 

Anki: 
I use Anki to review content that I’ve learned and have been creating a mixture of vocab cards, sentence cards, and adding useful phrases over time to slowly learn how to communicate with strangers. 

Passive learning: 
I’ve heard that watching television is a good way to get language input when you are not operating in the context of the target language you’re hoping to learn. Since I’m not in Ethiopia, I’ve been watching Besintu and other sitcoms to get a feel for how conversations flow. I don’t understand most of what is happening but can pick up key words and some verbs and I can feel my brain stretching to create meaning from the show. 

Altogether, I’m really serious about learning the language and want to make sure I’m approaching this process in a way that makes sense and maximizing my learning. 

Any advice or feedback is welcome! ",2025-07-12 16:30:11

ChatGPT Amharic Translation,"ሰላም ሰላም ውድ ቤተሰቦች

I wanted to inquire about your thoughts on the Amharic translation on ChatGPT. I use the translation of ChatGPT for quite a lot of things. It's excellent for a lot of languages, especially European languages, but also Arabic, Japanese, Turkish and the like. Even the Somali is good. The Amharic translation though is extremely lacking. It is currently slightly better I believe, previously it hallucinated an entire language of its own. Currently though, it somewhat makes sense but it spits a lot of gibberish. I demanded it for an explanation, and it told me it's because it wasn't trained on a lot of Amharic material, and I do believe that it's a shame. What are your thoughts on this? Do you care? And if so, do you think we as mere plebeians (and I am sure there are some patricians amongst us too) can effect change?

Gift Ideas for My Ethiopian Girlfriend (Amharic Speaker) – Would Love Your Input!,"Selam Reddit Ethiopia,

I’m reaching out with a question from the heart. I’m in a relationship with a wonderful 26-year-old Ethiopian woman who speaks Amharic, and I want to surprise her with a meaningful gift. I truly admire Ethiopian culture and would love to give her something that reflects that appreciation while also making her feel special and seen.

Since I’m not Ethiopian myself, I figured the best way to get this right is to ask you all directly:
What kind of gifts would be especially meaningful, thoughtful, or exciting for an Ethiopian woman?
This could be something cultural, modern, traditional, or even a mix—anything that shows I’ve made a real effort to understand and celebrate her background.

My budget is around 300 to 500 euros, so I’m open to a wide range of suggestions—from unique jewelry or cultural items to experiences, art, music, or anything else you think could really speak to her.

Whether you're speaking from personal experience or just sharing ideas, I’d be truly grateful to hear your thoughts. Thank you in advance—and amesegenallo!",2025-05-16 23:29:32

"The Verb 'To Be' & Existence: ነው (näw), አለ (allä), ሆነ (honä), and ነበረ (näbbärä) and More","
Selam Learns!

One of the most fundamental, yet sometimes complex, areas in Amharic grammar involves the verbs used for ""to be,"" ""to exist,"" and ""to become."" Unlike English which primarily uses ""to be,"" Amharic employs several distinct verbs – **ነው (nəw)**, **አለ (allä)**, **ነበረ (näbbärä)**, and **ሆነ (honä)** – each with specific roles. This post aims to clarify their usage, including their forms, tenses, and how they combine with other verbs.

Let's break them down:

---

## 1. ነው (nəw) - The Present Tense Copula (""is,"" ""am,"" ""are"")

**Function:** Links a subject with a noun or adjective in the *present tense* (identity/description). Think ""="" in the present. It does **not** express existence or location.
**Characteristics:** Present tense only; defective (doesn't conjugate like regular verbs).

**Conjugation (Present Tense):**

| Person | Pronoun     | Copula Form | Example Sentence (Subject + Noun/Adj + Copula)                     | Translation                       |
| :----- | :---------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| 1s     | እኔ (əne)    | **ነኝ (näñ)** | እኔ ተማሪ **ነኝ**። (*əne tämarie näñ*)                             | I **am** a student.               |
| 2m     | አንተ (antä)  | **ነህ (näh)** | አንተ ደግ **ነህ**። (*antä däg näh*)                               | You (m) **are** kind.             |
| 2f     | አንቺ (anči)  | **ነሽ (näš)** | አንቺ ሀኪም **ነሽ**። (*anči hakim näš*)                             | You (f) **are** a doctor.         |
| 3m     | እሱ (əssu)   | **ነው (nəw)** | እሱ መምህር **ነው**። (*əssu mämhər nəw*)                           | He **is** a teacher.              |
| 3f     | እሷ (əsswa)  | **ናት (nat)** | እሷ ረጅም **ናት**። (*əsswa räǧǧəm nat*)                           | She **is** tall.                  |
| 1p     | እኛ (əñña)   | **ነን (nän)** | እኛ ዝግጁ **ነን**። (*əñña zəgəǧǧu nän*)                           | We **are** ready.                 |
| 2p     | እናንተ (ənnantä)| **ናችሁ (naččəhu)** | እናንተ ጎበዞች **ናችሁ**። (*ənnantä gobäzočč naččəhu*)           | You (pl) **are** clever.          |
| 3p     | እነሱ (ənnässu) | **ናቸው (naččäw)** | እነሱ ጓደኞች **ናቸው**። (*ənnässu gwadäññočč naččäw*)           | They **are** friends.             |

**Negation:** **አይደለም (aydäläm)** + suffixes (e.g., *አይደለሁም (aydällähu(m))* - I am not).

---

## 2. አለ (allä) - The Present Tense Existential (""there is/are,"" ""to be present,"" ""to have"")

**Function:** Expresses existence, location, or possession in the *present tense*.
**Characteristics:** Present tense only; defective.

**Conjugation (Present Existential/Locative):**

| Person | Pronoun     | Existential Form | Example (Location/Existence)               | Example (Possession - with object suffix) | Translation (Possession) |
| :----- | :---------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |

| 2f     | አንቺ (anči)  | **አለሽ (alläš)** | አንቺ ስራ ቦታ **አለሽ**። (*anči səra bota alläš*) | እህት **አለሽ**? (*əhət alläš?*)           | Do you (f) **have** a sister? |
| 3m     | እሱ (əssu)   | **አለ (allä)**   | እሱ ውጪ **አለ**። (*əssu wəč'č'i allä*) | ውሻ **አለው**። (*wəšša alläw*)          | He **has** a dog.        |
| 3f     | እሷ (əsswa)  | **አለች (alläčč)** | እሷ ውስጥ **አለች**። (*əsswa wəst' alläčč*) | ድመት **አላት**። (*dəmät allat*)        | She **has** a cat.       |
| 1p     | እኛ (əñña)   | **አለን (allän)** | እኛ እዚህ **አለን**። (*əñña əzzih allän*) | ጊዜ **አለን**። (*gize allän*)           | We **have** time.        |
| 2p     | እናንተ (ənnantä)| **አላችሁ (allaččəhu)** | እናንተ ዝግጁ **አላችሁ**? (*ənnantä zəgəǧǧu allaččəhu?*) | ጥያቄ **አላችሁ**? (*t'əyaqe allaččəhu?*) | Do you (pl) **have** questions? |
| 3p     | እነሱ (ənnässu) | **አሉ (allu)**   | መጻሕፍት **አሉ**። (*mäs'ahəft allu*)     | ልጆች **አሏቸው**። (*ləǧočč allwaččäw*)   | They **have** children.  |

**Negation:** **የለም (yälläm)** + suffixes (e.g., *የለኝም (yälläññəm)* - I don't have; *የለም (yälläm)* - He isn't here / There isn't).

---

## 3. ነበረ (näbbärä) - The Past Tense Copula & Existential (""was,"" ""were,"" ""there was/were,"" ""used to be,"" ""had"")

**Function:** The *past tense* for both **ነው** (copula) and **አለ** (existential/possessive).
**Characteristics:** Primarily past tense; context distinguishes copula vs. existential meaning.

**Conjugation (Perfect Tense - Simple Past):**

| Person | Pronoun     | Past Form    | Example (Copula: Was/Were)                         | Example (Existential/Possessive: Was Present / Had) |

## 5. Advanced Forms & Auxiliary Usage

These verbs often combine with main verbs (like **ወረደ (wärrädä)** - to descend) to create nuanced tenses and aspects.

**5.1 The Converb ኖሮ (norō)**
*   From **ነበረ**. Means ""having been,"" ""since/because it was."" Links a past state/existence to a following clause.
    *   Example: እሱ እዚያ **ኖሮ**፣ ሁሉንም ነገር አይቷል። (*əssu əzziya **norō**, hullunəmm nägär ayətwall*) - **Having been** there, he has seen everything. / Because he was there...

**5.2 The Future Existential/Possessive: ይኖራል (yənoral)**
*   While ነበረ is past, its imperfective form **ይኖራል (yənoral)** functions as the *future existential* (""there will be,"" ""will be present"") and *future possessive* (""will have""). It fills the future gap for **አለ**.
    *   Example (Existential): ነገ ስብሰባ **ይኖራል**። (*nägä səbsäba **yənoral***) - There **will be** a meeting tomorrow.
    *   Example (Possessive): በሚቀጥለው ዓመት መኪና **ይኖረኛል**። (*bämmiqät't'əläw amät mäkina **yənoräññal***) - I **will have** a car next year.
    *   *Contrast with ይሆናል (yəhonall)*: **ይሆናል** is the future *copula* (will *be* something), **ይኖራል** is future *existence/possession* (there *will be* / *will have*).

**5.3 Compound Tenses/Aspects with Auxiliaries**
*   Structure: Main Verb (often Converb/Perfect/Imperfect) + Auxiliary (ነበረ, ሆነ, አለ, etc.). Let's use **ወረደ (wärrädä)** - to descend.

    *   **Present Perfect:** Main Verb Perfect + **አለ** suffix = **ወርዷል (wärədwal)**
        *   Meaning: He **has descended**. (Standard completed action with present relevance).
        *   እሱ ከተራራው **ወርዷል**። (*əssu kätäraraw **wärədwal***)

    *   **Past Perfect:** Main Verb Converb + **ነበረ** = **ወርዶ ነበር (wärədo näbbär)**
        *   Meaning: He **had descended**. (Action completed *before* another past point/event).
        *   እኛ ስንደርስ እሱ **ወርዶ ነበር**። (*əñña səndärs əssu **wärədo näbbär***) - When we arrived, he **had** already **descended**.

    *   **Imperfective (Present/Future):** Main Verb Imperfect + **አለ** suffix = **ይወርዳል (yəwärdall)**
        *   Meaning: He **descends** (habitual) / He **will descend** (simple future).
        *   በየቀኑ **ይወርዳል**። (*bäyäqänu **yəwärdall***) - He **descends** every day.
        *   ነገ **ይወርዳል**። (*nägä **yəwärdall***) - He **will descend** tomorrow.

    *   **Past Habitual/Conditional:** Main Verb Imperfect + **ነበረ** = **ይወርድ ነበር (yəwärd näbbär)**
        *   Meaning: He **used to descend** / He **would descend**.
        *   ድሮ በዚህ መንገድ **ይወርድ ነበር**። (*dəro bäzzih mängäd **yəwärd näbbär***) - He **used to descend** this way back then.
        *   ገንዘብ ቢኖረኝ ኖሮ፣ አብሬው **እወርድ ነበር**። (*gänzäb binoräñ noro, abréw **əwärd näbbär***) - If I had had money, I **would have descended** with him. (Conditional)

    *   **Future Perfect / Probable Past:** Main Verb Converb + **ይሆናል** = **ወርዶ ይሆናል (wärədo yəhonall)**
        *   Meaning: He **will have descended** / He **might have descended** / He **probably descended**. (Expresses future completion or past probability).
        *   እስከ ምሽት ድረስ **ወርዶ ይሆናል**። (*əskä məšət dərəs **wärədo yəhonall***) - He **will have descended** by evening.
        *   ለምን ዘገየ? ምናልባት **ወርዶ ይሆናል**። (*lämən zägäyyä? mənalbat **wärədo yəhonall***) - Why is he late? Maybe he **has** already **descended**.

    *   **Probable Future/Present:** Main Verb Imperfect + **ይሆናል** = **ይወርድ ይሆናል (yəwärd yəhonall)**
        *   Meaning: He **might descend** / He **will probably descend** / He **probably descends**. (Expresses future/present probability).
        *   ዝናብ ከመምጣቱ በፊት **ይወርድ ይሆናል**። (*zənab kämämt'atu bäfit **yəwärd yəhonall***) - He **will probably descend** before the rain comes.

Comprehensive Amharic Grammar Charts That I Made,"I have been learning Amharic fairly intensively for about a year and a half. A lot of the resources I found were not comprehensive enough for my liking. They left out a lot of the irregularities, especially when it comes to nouns. This is a collection of everything I’ve gotten from multiple resources over my time learning, not only from books but also from encountering words in my reading, and in speaking with people while living in Ethiopia. Think of it as a cheat sheet. I use Appleyard’s transliteration convention where ä is the first order and ï is the 6^(th) order, and I include gemination. [Here is the link to a PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19V019KEGu9M9Qohc4pTysTtuAJV-TX1s/view?usp=sharing) of the grammar charts and here is what is inside and some explanations:

1. Verb Conjugation

a.      Basic Stems

i.      Basic Stems – A comprehensive table of every single basic verb type and the conjugation in every possible tense or change. As is convention, they are listed in 3^(rd) person masculine singular

ii.      አለ conjugation - a complete table, since this is the most irregular verb in Amharic

iii.      Irregular verbs – a table of 3 more irregular verbs. There are gaps here, because I couldn’t find explanations in any resources for the conjugations beyond the basics, and I didn’t want to guess. If anyone knows the rest of the conjugations, feel free to comment and I’ll add them and re-upload with an update.

b.      Derived Stems - For all of these tables, I highlight in yellow where particular stems differ from their basic stem counterparts. If it's not highlighted in yellow, you can assume the stem is essentially the same, it's only the prefixes and/or suffixes that change.

i.      A- Causative stems 

ii.      As- Causative stems 

iii.      Tä- Passive Stems 

iv.      At + C- Type Stems

c.      Reduplicative Stems

i.      Reduplicative Basic Stems

ii.      Reduplicative Tä- Passive Stems

iii.      Reduplicative A- Causative Stems

iv.      Reduplicative As- Causative Stems

v.      Reduplicative At- + C Stems

d.      Miscellaneous

i.      An- Stems

ii.      Tän- Stems

iii.      Astä- Stems

2.      Pronouns

a.      Verb Pronoun Prefixes and Suffixes

b.      Other Pronouns – Both stand-alone and prefixes and suffixes. This includes possessives, and object pronouns and how they shift after different vowels and consonants as well as the -ll- and -bb- infixes

3.      Compound Verb Tenses – This is large table of many compound tenses. These are ways in which a lot of infixes and random words combine to create new grammatical meanings. These largely came from Wolf Leslau’s Amharic Textbook, but he doesn’t have them organized anywhere; they just show up sporadically throughout his 50 chapters. If you memorize all of these, you should be able to speak much more fluently than without them. They include the ‘formula’ for the structure, an example sentence in Amharic, and its English translation. I tried to include two examples per formula if it was ambiguous what the meaning was from just one, or if it could have two meanings.

4.      Irregular Verb Lists – Strictly speaking these aren’t irregular, but they’re just not A-type verbs, and most verbs in Amharic that are 2 or 3 syllables with first order vowels are A-type. So memorizing the most common ones that aren’t will help you get gemination correct.

a.      B-type verbs – these are the most common non-A type verbs

b.      C-type verbs

c.      X-type verbs

d.      Y-type verbs

e.      Alä composite verbs – these are verbs which are a combination of alä and a noun or adjective before it to create a new meaning

f.        Verbs requiring alä in the gerundive before them (mainly thoughts and feelings) – this is super important and not covered at all in any resource I could find. If you don’t use this grammatical structure before these verbs, people usually don’t understand what you mean

g.      At + C- verbs

h.      Astä- verbs

5.      Nouns

a.      Irregular plurals – These mainly come from Ge’ez and people don’t always consistently use their Ge’ez forms; sometimes they do mix with the standard Amharic plural. Generally, the irregular plural suffix is -at (from Ge’ez), less often -an, but there are several exceptions. Because of the Ge’ez influence, many of these words are religious, but there are also several related to time.

b.      Feminine Nouns – This is a table of nouns generally considered to be feminine. 98% of nouns in Amharic are masculine, and even many of the feminine nouns are kind of dual purpose; people do still sometimes use them as masculine. I’ve tried to put asterisks by those nouns. Two things to note are that making a masculine noun feminine implies some kind of appreciation for it, and secondly, all countries are considered feminine, and many animals. So the noun for country is feminine, but also if you mention a specific country the agreements should be feminine. Same with the word for bird – it is feminine, but also if you mention a specific type of bird, it should be feminine.

c.      Acronyms – these are things I ran across in books and news articles. It’s an incomplete list. If anyone knows what the ones I’m missing stand for please let me know. In some cases, I had a decent guess, but I didn’t want to chance it and be incorrect.

6.      Proverbs – a table of 60 proverbs. I’m only missing the meaning for one (let me know if you know it). All of these are things I encountered in speech with people or in books that I’ve read.

7.      Filler words – a basic list of words with no real meaning that people insert in their sentences.

 

Hope this is helpful. Please comment letting me know if there are any mistakes you see, or if you know words that can fill in the gaps.",2025-05-01 07:15:46

Interesting carved characters on old rifle...,"Greetings! I recently purchased an antique French rifle (Fusil Gras M1874) that was part of a large cache of weapons imported from Ethiopia. The rifle has markings that I would love to understand, so I was hopeful that someone would be able to tell me what the language is and what it says. Here is my handwritten copy of what is on the rifle and where the carvings are located on it. Any help on understanding the historic context would also be greatly appreciated! Thank you!!!

Struggling with Amharic Grammar? This is by Far the Best Resource.,"If anyone’s struggling with Amharic grammar, the best resource by far is the *Reference Grammar of Amharic* written by the late Wolf Leslau. It’s a massive book, and I don’t think anyone should read this cover to cover, but if you don’t understand a specific grammatical construction or concept, this book is absolutely the best and most comprehensive resource. It gives all the verb conjugations, explains complicated (and simple) issues that many people have with Amharic. It also details some outdated and archaic Amharic, so rather than taking what the book says as a prescription, you should use it to understand what other people are saying and the things that you don’t understand. It gives tons of examples (a few of which are mistaken, dialectical, or incorrect); however, the vast majority of the time, this book will aid you. Honestly, I’m learning it as a second language, and this book has been a great help to me on my journey towards fluency. 

This book is very expensive to buy a physical copy of. But I'm sure you can find a copy of it online if you're searching the right places.",2025-04-22 17:59:06

Looking up double consonants,"ሰላም! I’ve noticed that double consonants are very frequent in Amharic, despite not being marked in writing. I wondered if you knew where one can conveniently look up the correct pronunciation of a word? Online dictionaries only give incomplete transliteration without double consonants. Google Translate speech synthesator generally pronounces double vowels where they should be, but it’s often hard to catch with a beginner’s ear if a consonant is doubled or not.

Like, how do I know that there are double consonants in ድመት (dəmmät), ውሻ (wəšša), or ፍየል (fəyyäl), but not in ፈረስ (färäs) or አሳማ (asama)? Don’t native speakers themselves get confused and need to look it up?

Another issue is whether a consonant is pronounced with the vowel ə or not. How do I know that ክረምት is krämt instead of \*krämət or \*kərämət, but ትንሽ is tənnəš not \*tənš? Or ወይም being wäyəm instead of \*wäym?",2025-01-30 00:01:46

I vaguely understand from online translators that this is talking about metalworkers in Aksum that were highly regarded up to a certain time. However, depending on the translator, it gives a different century (one says ""until the end of the 19th century"" and another the 20th century. The man that helped me translate it many years ago wrote ""20th century"" but I just want to confirm since it is for a publication. Can someone please clarify for me?

Why and when did አ and ኣ  start being pronounced in the same way?,"At one point, did these letters (like in Tigrinya) have distinct pronunciations in Amharic? What caused them to change? I’m also curious about ሀ and ሃ which observes the same pattern.

It seems possible that medieval or early Amharic retained these sound distinctions, which became less distinct over time. I wonder if this shift was influenced by differences between the Amharic spoken by the nobility and that spoken by the general population, or possibly the result of Cushitic language features becoming more pronounced as Amharic developed (unlike Tigrinya which remained relatively isolated). I haven’t found any resources on this, so any insight would be helpful!

Needing help translating a feeling from English to Amharic!,"Just to give some context, I wanted to kind of explain the situation I have on hand. A good friend of mine was adopted from Ethiopia when he was 13- his birth mom passed away and he was subsequently adopted by an American family alongside his biological younger sister. 

A few weeks ago, his younger sister passed away in a truly tragic and sudden manner. So, now along side the loss itself, being left in a situation at which he no longer has any remaining blood family members has obviously taken a really big toll on him. 

Additionally, since he'd been adopted at 13, after spending a decent amount of time in the orphanage- his ability to speak or understand Amharic is essentially gone. 

He's allowing me to design a memorial tattoo for him and I'm really wanting to find the best way to communicate the concept I'm going for. I know most things are context related and I'm not going to get anywhere with some translating software or something. 

So, anyway. I'd ideally like to find some sort of saying, phrase, or word that evokes a feeling of ""everything will be okay"", ""we're always here with you"", ""love is eternal"", ""you are never alone"", etc. in some way shape or form. Something to reflect the idea that, just because they aren't physically here with him doesn't mean that their memory/spirit/love/souls have vanished. Some like philosophical reassurance or comforting- even if it's like something like ""our souls are tied"", just something neutral or positive, rather than saying something like ""I am never going to be whole without you. I will wallow in sorrow until the day I die"".  That's super dramatic but you get this point. 

If somebody could help steer me in the right direction I could really use the help!! If there's any further context needed for this to make most sense please let me know!!!",2024-09-13 07:48:05

Question about ያለው ማነው,"Hello!  I'm trying to work out a detailed translation of this sentence (called a ""gloss"").  This is for a university project I'm doing on Amharic.

ዛሬ      ጥዋት       “ባቡር”    ያለው                  ማነው?   
zare     ṭəwat         babur    y-al-äw              man-äw  
today   morning    train      REL-said-DEF    who-DEF  
'Who said 'train' this morning?'

I'm specifically wondering about ያለው ማነው.  I've tried to break the words down into their constituent parts (prefixes/suffixes), but I'm not sure if I've translated them correctly.  REL stands for ""relative"" – it's what you get in things like **የ**መጣው ሰው ('the man who came'), and DEF stands for ""definite"" – like the definite article ""the"" in English, or in ውሻ**ው** ('the dog').

What I'm trying to figure out is if the ያ- in ያለው is the same type of thing as the relative marker የ- in **የ**መጣው ሰው, and if the two instances of -ው in ያለው ማነው is the same kind of thing as the definite marker -ው in ውሻ**ው**, if that makes sense.  If *not*, does anyone have a sense of what else these prefixes/suffixes might mean?

Also, is the verb ያለው conjugated for third person singular male, like ""he said""?  Or is it just unspecified?
