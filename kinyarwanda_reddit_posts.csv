Sometimes  there’s distance, awkwardness, or even unspoken disapproval.

It’s like everything shifts after they share their truth.
I’m wondering why do you think this happens?
Is it fear of cultural beliefs, or just a lack of understanding?

What is it like for a British tourist in Kigali?,"Hello everybody

So I am 27yo and from Scotland in the UK. I want to do a masters degree at a university in Africa and I heard that Kigali is the safest city in Africa. 

So I have decided to book a holiday to Kigali later this year... for a month, just to see what it is like living there. I think that is a bit much too much time... is the cost of living cheap in Kigali? Because I dont think I have put enough thought into booking this holiday... but I have just booked it. I can't change it now. 

I've read on this forum that there isn't anything to do in Kigali, is that correct? And that people speak Kinyarwandan and not English? I dont think I can learn an entire language in a few months...

What is Kigali like? Are people nice to foreigners? Is it true there is no crime? I am not worried, I just don't want to be hassled all the time. 

Does nobody speak English? I heard English was the official language, and Rwanda is part of the British Commonwealth, so I thought it would be fine. 

Should I just go to Kampala now instead, and just spend a week in Kigali or something?

I really wanted Kigali to be the one I liked, but I heard Kampalans speak more English. 

Thank you. ",2025-08-08 16:55:51

"Hello, friends. I would like to ask if the price of renting a car is expensive.","Hello, friends! I am a foreigner who will soon be visiting your beautiful country. I contacted someone online who said he works for a car rental company. His quote is:

Toyota RAV4 $39.90/day → $1,050/month

Kia Sorento $54.90/day → $1,420/month

Toyota Land Cruiser Prado $79.90/day → $2,100/month

I would like to ask if this price is reasonable. Also, is there anything I need to be aware of? Are there any hidden fees? He said there are no hidden fees and no deposit is required.

	•	Do you feel pressure to look rich even when you’re not?
	•	What’s the craziest thing you’ve seen someone do just to “keep up”?

Africans: how are you sending money across borders today? We’re building a better way.,"Hi all 👋🏾

I'm part of a small team building **AfriX** — a digital wallet that helps Africans send and receive **local currency** across borders instantly (like from Nigeria to Ghana) using **blockchain-backed stablecoins** and **mobile money integrations**.

We’re tired of seeing people pay $30–$50 to send $100 across African borders — or waiting 5 days for funds to arrive.

Instead of routing through USD or banks abroad, AfriX lets you:

✅ Send/receive **Naira, Cedis, Shillings** directly  
✅ Use **MoMo wallets** (MTN, Airtel, M-PESA, etc.) to cash in/out  
✅ Pay merchants or people instantly across Africa  
✅ Skip FX stress with local currency-backed stablecoins

We’re starting in **Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Egypt**, and launching a **closed beta in a few months**.

🔎 **Question for you:**  
How do *you* currently send/receive money across African countries?  
What’s your biggest frustration? Would you trust a wallet like this?

💬 Let us know in the comments — we’re listening.

✅ Want early access? Join our waitlist in the comments.  
(No spam — just beta access and updates when we go live)

Thanks for reading. Hoping to build something truly local and powerful for Africa 🙏🏾

I'm a writer, and I'm trying to make a character that was born in Rwanda, although he later moved to Kenya. I'm going to make an active effort toward writing this character accurately based on Rwandan and Kenyan cultures, and the first step to that is giving him a name!

However, I cannot find much confirmation online as to whether these are surnames or first names, and unfortunately, I am very naive about the name-culture right now.

If Rwanda is the ''Singapour of Africa'' then why are so many Rwandans leaving?,"Because shit jobs with shit pay. Or worse, no jobs at all. 

Because no free speech. You have to play dumb and pretend ''all is well'' to survive. Hypocrisy is rewarded.

Because most of the foreign aid and investment money goes into Crystal Ventures (Kagame's company) bank account, for himself and his fellow ''RPF elite'' to enjoy.

''When an economy is struggling, it’s common for citizens to emigrate in search of better opportunities, a phenomenon known as outward migration. But how do we explain the constant outflow of citizens from Rwanda, a country whose authoritarian leader frequently refers to it as the ""Singapore of Africa""? If Rwanda is truly a model of prosperity and stability, why do its citizens continue to leave in large numbers, year after year, to settle in neighbouring East African countries such as Uganda and SADC Countries? What exactly are they fleeing from, and why aren't they choosing to remain in their supposed paradise?''

Can you help answer the following questions from a curious tourist?,"Spent 7 days in Rwanda as a solo female traveler and had an amazing time! After reflecting on my observations, I have the following questions for locals

**Things I Smelled**

1. I was surprised by the smoke smell in Kigali and Musanze in the middle of July. Is the smoke smell less strong in the winter time? Which months does it get better? 

2. Body odor: deodorant seems to be sold in grocery stores but from walking past people on the street, it doesn't seem to be widely used. I wonder, do locals also notice the smell of body odor? What is the general perception of body odor and perfumes/cologne? Coming from the US, I have experienced the opposite where people like to heavily spray perfumes/cologne to the point where the perfume smell can be overwhelming.  

**Things I Saw**

1. In Kimihurura Roundabout Park late at night, are there foxes or fox like animals? I saw a four legged animal from the back but the tail seemed too bushy to be a dog or cat?

2. From walking in Kigali, I saw a lot of young kids/toddlers with parents but never saw kids throwing tantrums/cry/complain. This is a stark contrast to what I observe in NYC where on the subway, often times kids will throw tantrums/whine to parents. How do parents teach young kids to be so well behaved?

3. This relates to question 2 but how is everyone raised to be so calm? Is this specific to Rwanda or does this calmness trait apply to people of neighboring countries as well? Are people secretly anxious or worried about things but just do a great job of masking it in the facial expressions? I don't think I ever saw any moto taxi driver get angry or raise their voice even when cars are cutting them off. This level of calmness was the biggest culture shock to witness coming from NYC where I see different personalities and a lot of people expressing their emotions. In Rwanda, I found myself speaking more softly and quietly to mirror the cultural norm. 

**Other Questions**

1. For Rwandans who have traveled outside the country, what was the biggest surprise to you and where did you visit? 

2. I personally did not bargain with moto drivers, do locals in Kigali bargain with moto drivers on the price of their ride?

"Since you had mixed feelings last week about Google Gemini's testimony on how it could pull common Rwandans out of poverty, let's try Grok 3 this time: If poor 3rd-worlders from Rwanda are gifted smartphones for the very first time, how could they use Grok 3 to improve and enrich their lives?","If poor 3rd-worlders from Rwanda are gifted smartphones for the very first time, how could they use Grok 3 to improve and enrich their lives?

===

Grok 3 replied:

If people in Rwanda, particularly those in impoverished communities, receive smartphones for the first time, Grok 3—xAI’s advanced AI chatbot—could be a powerful tool to improve and enrich their lives in practical and transformative ways. By leveraging its accessibility through mobile apps (iOS and Android) and its features like Think Mode, DeepSearch, and real-time information retrieval, Rwandans could address challenges and seize opportunities in education, agriculture, entrepreneurship, healthcare, and community development. Below are specific ways they could use Grok 3, tailored to the context of a low-income, resource-constrained environment:

### 1. **Education and Skill Development**
- **Access to Knowledge and Learning Resources**: Grok 3 can provide instant answers to questions on a wide range of topics, from basic literacy and numeracy to advanced subjects like science and coding. For example, a young Rwandan could ask, “How do I improve my reading skills?” or “What is algebra?” and receive clear, step-by-step explanations. Its ability to process complex queries and generate human-like text makes it a virtual tutor for self-paced learning.[](https://www.newoaks.ai/blog/how-to-use-grok-3-creative-projects/)[](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Grok-3-model-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know)
- **Language Learning**: Many Rwandans speak Kinyarwanda, but learning English or French could open job opportunities. Grok 3 can assist with language practice, offering conversational exercises, grammar tips, or translations. For instance, a user could say, “Teach me basic English phrases for business,” and Grok 3 could provide tailored lessons.
- **Skill-Building for Jobs**: Grok 3’s coding capabilities (demonstrated by its 79.4% score on LiveCodeBench) could help aspiring tech workers learn programming basics, like Python, even with limited internet. Users could ask, “How do I write a simple program?” and receive functional code examples.[](https://x.ai/news/grok-3)

### 2. **Agriculture and Livelihood Improvement**
- **Farming Advice**: Agriculture is a backbone of Rwanda’s economy, with many relying on subsistence farming. Grok 3 can provide practical advice on crop management, pest control, or soil fertility. For example, a farmer could ask, “How do I protect my maize from pests without chemicals?” and Grok 3 could suggest affordable, organic methods based on its knowledge base.
- **Market Information**: Using DeepSearch, Grok 3 can pull real-time data (if internet is available) on crop prices or market trends, helping farmers decide what to grow or when to sell. A query like “What’s the price of beans in Kigali markets?” could inform better trading decisions.[](https://www.zdnet.com/article/grok-3-ai-is-now-free-to-all-x-users-heres-how-it-works/)
- **Climate Adaptation**: Grok 3 can offer insights on weather patterns or climate-resilient farming techniques. A user could ask, “How do I farm during a drought?” and receive tips like water-saving irrigation methods suited to Rwanda’s conditions.

### 3. **Entrepreneurship and Economic Opportunities**
- **Business Ideas and Planning**: Grok 3 can help aspiring entrepreneurs brainstorm low-cost business ideas. For example, a user could ask, “What small business can I start with 10,000 RWF?” and Grok 3 might suggest ideas like selling second-hand clothes or starting a small vegetable stand, with steps to get started.
- **Financial Literacy**: Grok 3 can explain basic financial concepts, like budgeting or saving, in simple terms. A query like “How do I save money on a small income?” could yield practical advice, such as tracking expenses or joining local savings groups (common in Rwanda).
- **Access to Digital Platforms**: Smartphones enable access to mobile money platforms like MTN Mobile Money, widely used in Rwanda. Grok 3 could guide users on setting up accounts or using digital payments securely, asking, “How do I use mobile money to pay for goods?”[](https://www.assurant.com/news-insight/insights/mobile-connected-world/article/ways-smartphones-help-people-in-developing-countries)

### 4. **Healthcare and Well-Being**
- **Health Information**: Grok 3 can provide basic health advice, like “What are the symptoms of malaria?” or “How do I treat a fever at home?” This is critical in areas with limited healthcare access. While not a substitute for doctors, it can help users make informed decisions or know when to seek professional care.
- **Nutrition Guidance**: Malnutrition is a challenge in some Rwandan communities. Grok 3 could suggest affordable, nutritious meals using local ingredients, answering queries like “What’s a healthy meal I can make with beans and bananas?”
- **Mental Health Support**: Grok 3’s conversational abilities, including its upcoming Voice Mode, could offer basic emotional support or stress management tips. A user might say, “I feel stressed about money,” and Grok 3 could suggest coping strategies or mindfulness exercises.[](https://www.zdnet.com/article/grok-3-ai-is-now-free-to-all-x-users-heres-how-it-works/)[](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/grok-3s-voice-mode-is-unhinged-and-thats-the-point)

### 5. **Community Development and Connectivity**
- **Access to Information**: Smartphones connect remote communities to information. Grok 3 can answer community-focused questions, like “How do we start a cooperative for farmers?” or “What are government programs for youth in Rwanda?” This empowers groups to organize and access resources.
- **Cultural Preservation**: Grok 3 could help document local knowledge or traditions. A user could ask, “How do I record a Kinyarwanda folktale?” and receive guidance on using the smartphone to create audio or text records, preserving cultural heritage.
- **Networking**: Grok 3 can suggest ways to use platforms like X (accessible via the smartphone) to connect with others, such as finding mentors or joining online communities for Rwandan entrepreneurs.

### 6. **Practical Considerations and Accessibility**
- **Ease of Use**: Grok 3 is available for free on the X platform, iOS, and Android apps, with limited quotas for non-subscribers. Its mobile apps are user-friendly, and Voice Mode (available on iOS/Android) allows illiterate users to interact via speech, critical in a country where literacy rates are improving but not universal.[](https://www.zdnet.com/article/grok-3-ai-is-now-free-to-all-x-users-heres-how-it-works/)[](https://medium.com/vertical-bar-media/grok-ai-now-available-as-mobile-app-vbm-5255fa5d5b35)
- **Low-Resource Compatibility**: Grok 3 mini, designed for low-compute scenarios, could work better on basic smartphones or with limited internet, making it suitable for rural Rwanda.[](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Grok-3-model-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know)[](https://x.ai/news/grok-3)
- **Language Support**: While Grok 3 primarily operates in English, its conversational nature could adapt to simple English queries or, with future updates, potentially support Kinyarwanda, making it more accessible.

### Challenges and Recommendations
- **Internet Access**: Rwanda has made strides in mobile connectivity (over 70% mobile penetration), but rural areas may lack consistent internet. Users could rely on Grok 3’s offline capabilities (if available) or use it during visits to areas with connectivity, like community centers.[](https://www.assurant.com/news-insight/insights/mobile-connected-world/article/ways-smartphones-help-people-in-developing-countries)
- **Digital Literacy**: First-time smartphone users may need basic training. Grok 3 could assist by answering, “How do I use my smartphone?” with step-by-step guidance.
- **Cultural Relevance**: Users should frame questions specifically (e.g., “What crops grow best in Rwanda’s volcanic soil?”) to get tailored responses, as Grok 3’s general knowledge may not always account for local context.
- **Ethical Use**: Given past controversies (e.g., Grok 3’s unprompted political responses), users should verify sensitive information with local sources, like agricultural extension officers or health workers.[](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/a-rogue-employee-was-behind-groks-unprompted-white-genocide-mentions)[](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musks-ai-chatbot-grok-brings-south-african-white-genocide-claims-rcna206838)

### Getting Started
To use Grok 3, Rwandans would need to:
1. Download the Grok app from the iOS App Store or Android Play Store (or use X if pre-installed).
2. Sign in with an X account (free to create) or use the standalone app.[](https://medium.com/vertical-bar-media/grok-ai-now-available-as-mobile-app-vbm-5255fa5d5b35)
3. Ask questions via text or voice, starting with simple queries like “How do I grow tomatoes?” or “What jobs are available in Kigali?”
4. Use Think Mode for complex problem-solving (e.g., “How do I budget for a small shop?”) or DeepSearch for research (e.g., “What are Rwanda’s export crops?”).[](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Grok-3-model-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know)

### Example Scenario
A Rwandan farmer, Marie, receives a smartphone and learns to use Grok 3. She asks, “How can I increase my potato yield?” Grok 3 suggests crop rotation, affordable fertilizers, and local seed varieties. She then asks, “Where can I sell potatoes in Gisenyi?” and DeepSearch provides market contacts. Later, she uses Voice Mode to learn basic English for negotiating with buyers, improving her income.

By providing actionable knowledge, Grok 3 can empower Rwandans to overcome barriers, build skills, and connect with opportunities, significantly enriching their lives despite resource constraints.[](https://www.newoaks.ai/blog/how-to-use-grok-3-creative-projects/)[](https://www.zdnet.com/article/grok-3-ai-is-now-free-to-all-x-users-heres-how-it-works/)[](https://www.assurant.com/news-insight/insights/mobile-connected-world/article/ways-smartphones-help-people-in-developing-countries)",2025-07-28 18:15:51

"Since you didn't like yesterday's ChatGPT contribution, let's try Google Gemini this time: ""If poor 3rd-worlders from Rwanda are gifted smartphones for the very first time, how could they use Google Gemini to improve and enrich their lives?""","Google Gemini answered this way:

For individuals in Rwanda receiving smartphones for the first time, Google Gemini could be a transformative tool to significantly improve and enrich their lives in numerous ways. Here are some key areas:
1. Education and Information Access:
 * Personalized Learning: Gemini can act as a personal tutor, explaining complex concepts in various subjects, from basic literacy and numeracy to more advanced topics. It can provide practice quizzes and adapt to individual learning paces and styles.
 * Language Translation: For a country with multiple languages, Gemini's translation capabilities can help bridge communication gaps, allowing access to information and learning materials in their local languages, or helping them learn new languages for broader opportunities.
 * Access to Information: Users can ask Gemini about anything – health, agriculture, local news, history, or global events. It can summarize complex articles, explain unfamiliar terms, and provide information in an easily understandable format, bridging the information gap often present in remote or underserved areas.
 * Digital Literacy: Gemini can help users navigate their new smartphones and other digital tools, teaching them about online safety, how to use various apps, and general digital literacy skills.
2. Health and Well-being:
 * Health Information: Users can inquire about common illnesses, symptoms, preventative measures, and basic first aid. While Gemini should not replace professional medical advice, it can provide immediate, accessible information that can be crucial in areas with limited healthcare access.
 * Hygiene and Sanitation: Gemini can offer advice on best practices for hygiene, safe drinking water, and sanitation, contributing to public health.
 * Nutrition and Food Security: It can provide information on balanced diets, local food sources, and even offer simple recipes or advice on preserving food.
 * Mental Health Support: While not a therapist, Gemini can offer general advice on stress management, mindfulness, and direct users to appropriate resources if available.
3. Economic Empowerment and Livelihoods:
 * Agricultural Advice: Farmers can use Gemini to get real-time information on weather patterns, crop diseases, pest control, soil health, and best farming practices specific to their region, potentially leading to improved yields and income.
 * Market Information: Gemini could help users understand market prices for their produce or goods, identify potential buyers, and learn about fair trade practices.
 * Skill Development: Individuals can learn new skills relevant to local industries or entrepreneurship, such as basic business management, financial literacy, crafting techniques, or even digital skills for remote work.
 * Entrepreneurship Support: Gemini can assist aspiring entrepreneurs with brainstorming business ideas, creating simple business plans, understanding small business loans (if available), and marketing strategies.
 * Financial Inclusion: Gemini can explain concepts related to mobile banking, digital payments, and savings, helping to increase financial literacy and access to financial services.
4. Community Development and Engagement:
 * Civic Engagement: Gemini can provide information about local governance, civic rights, and community initiatives, fostering more informed and engaged citizens.
 * Cultural Preservation: Users can leverage Gemini to document and share their local history, traditions, and stories, contributing to cultural preservation.
 * Emergency Information: In times of natural disasters or other emergencies, Gemini could provide critical, up-to-date information and safety guidelines.
Challenges and Considerations:
While the potential is immense, it's important to consider challenges:
 * Connectivity: Access to reliable internet is crucial for Gemini to function effectively.
 * Literacy Levels: While Gemini can aid literacy, some users may initially struggle with text-based interfaces. Voice input and output will be vital.
 * Digital Divide: Ensuring equitable access to smartphones and connectivity across all demographics.
 * Responsible AI Use: Addressing potential biases in AI, ensuring information is accurate and culturally relevant, and protecting user privacy.
 * Local Content and Context: The effectiveness of Gemini will be enhanced if it's trained on and can provide information relevant to the specific Rwandan context, including local languages, customs, and agricultural practices.
By thoughtfully deploying and supporting access to tools like Google Gemini, there's a significant opportunity to empower individuals in Rwanda and contribute to broader socio-economic development.

"If poor 3rd-worlders from Rwanda are gifted smartphones for the very first time, how could they use ChatGPT to improve and enrich their lives?","If people in Rwanda—or any developing country—are gifted smartphones and gain access to ChatGPT, the impact could be transformative, especially when paired with affordable internet. Here’s how they could use ChatGPT to enrich and improve their lives:


---

📚 Education & Self-Improvement

1. Tutoring & Homework Help: Learn math, science, reading, and other school subjects with step-by-step explanations in their native language or English.


2. Language Learning: Practice English, French, Swahili, or Kinyarwanda—chatting back and forth, correcting grammar, and even voice assistance if enabled.


3. Study for Exams: Prepare for national or international exams (e.g., high school tests, college entry, IELTS, TOEFL).


4. Offline Lessons: Generate simple lessons they can save and read later without needing the internet.




---

💰 Income Generation

1. Business Ideas: Get ideas for small local businesses tailored to their environment—like poultry farming, soap making, or solar phone charging.


2. Freelancing Guidance: Learn how to use platforms like Upwork or Fiverr for remote digital work (graphic design, writing, translation).


3. Agriculture Tips: Ask for advice on how to grow crops better, prevent disease in livestock, or start a cooperative.


4. Resume & Job Search Help: Write professional resumes or CVs, prepare for interviews, and explore global job markets.




---

🧠 Life Skills & Critical Thinking

1. Financial Literacy: Learn budgeting, saving, avoiding scams, and understanding loans or mobile money like M-Pesa or MTN Mobile Money.


2. Health Literacy: Ask health questions (e.g., hygiene, nutrition, sexual health, common diseases) and get safe, non-judgmental advice.


3. Problem Solving: Get help making everyday decisions—how to fix a bicycle, settle a disagreement, or cook healthier meals.




---

🌍 Civic Awareness & Empowerment

1. Know Your Rights: Learn about their rights under Rwandan law (especially helpful for women, children, or marginalized communities).


2. Community Organizing: Get help writing petitions, organizing community projects, or starting NGOs or youth clubs.


3. News Summarization: Get summaries of global or local news in clear, understandable language.




---

🎨 Creativity & Self-Expression

1. Writing & Poetry: Write stories, poems, or songs in their voice—build literacy and personal expression.


2. Art & Design Ideas: Brainstorm crafts, traditional art forms, or digital design skills they can learn and sell.


3. Cultural Preservation: Ask about how to document local history, folktales, or oral traditions using writing or audio.




---

🔧 Technical Guidance

1. Basic Coding Skills: Start learning how to code websites or apps, with support in Python, HTML, or Scratch.


2. Phone Troubleshooting: Learn how to care for and repair smartphones or solar chargers.


3. Use Free Tools: Get links and instructions for using other free AI tools, public domain textbooks, and mobile apps.




---

🛑 Challenges to Consider:

Internet Access: ChatGPT needs data or Wi-Fi. Solutions could include local caching or community hubs with free access.

Digital Literacy: First-time users need guidance on how to type, search, and ask clear questions.

Language Barriers: More support in Swahili or Kinyarwanda would help adoption (ChatGPT can help, but quality varies).

Misinformation: Users need digital literacy to tell helpful advice from misunderstanding or hallucination.



---

Summary:
If supported with basic infrastructure and guidance, ChatGPT could be a personal tutor, doctor, business advisor, counselor, and creative partner—all in one—accessible from a single smartphone.

HELP!!! I think I'm too awkward for Kigali,"I don't really know how to say this without sounding weird, but I'm gonna try. I'm a non-Rwandan African living in kigali.  I've been here a while, I work remotely, which is both a blessing and a curse....., mostly because it makes it harder to find genuine community. I feel like the 2 main social groups I've encountered is the expat crowd (who are mostly doing their own thing in their own bubble) and locals (who are nice but have their own long time friend groups and aren't always looking to add new people), I get it no -shade to anyone. It just makes meeting You're kind of people tricky. 

I'm not into clubbing, networking for the sake of it, or sitting through a panel of 'the future of east African fintech', I'm just looking for thoughtful open-minded people who enjoy talking about real things, laughing about life,  may be meeting up at  cafes,  sharing random memes and just existing in the same space with no pressure.

Activities in Rwanda,"Hey everyone!

I’ll be staying in Rwanda for 4–5 months starting around October, super excited for my first time there! 🇷🇼

I’ve been looking into activities like safaris, gorilla trekking, volcano hikes, etc., but I saw the prices for foreigners are pretty steep (e.g., $1500 for gorillas 😅). Totally understandable, but I’m on a tighter budget and I’d love to explore as much as possible while respecting Rwandan culture and the people during my stay.

Since I’ll be living and working/studying in Kigali, I was wondering:

Do residents/long-term visitors with a work visa/student permit get discounted rates?

Any local tour operators or insider tips to experience these trips without breaking the bank?

Any lesser-known spots or budget-friendly alternatives to the big tourist experiences?


Thanks so much in advance, I’m really looking forward to making the most of my time in Rwanda! 🙌",2025-07-21 15:35:58

One thing I wish to ask that is not very clear with the tour packages: if we hire porters, do we have to pay for their permits too?

Thank you! Really excited to visit Kigali and Rwanda!

	•	Sports and fitness camps
	•	Community service or volunteer programs
	•	Career exploration camps (STEM, business, etc.)

Realistic cost of building a house in Rwanda,"We moved in Rwanda a few year ago and we wanted to settle her and have a permeant home. I wanted to buy a house through Rwanda's cyamunara (https://iecms.gov.rw/auction?page=0) but costs there seems ridiculous. For instance, [this unfinished house ](https://pdfhost.io/v/fEHagUvaPm_Kigali_Unfinished_house_valuation)is quoted at a market value of 178M. Mind you the house is located in Rusoro and this is not even finished! My question to anyone who is familiar with the Rwandan market:

1. How much would to build the super-structure (foundations, columns, beams, slab upwards, door and window schedules, flooring, roofing, lintels, and parapets and roofing ) of a house like this?
2. I want to build myself a three stories house (600sqm) but to save cost, I want to hire a local contract to build the super-structure of the house (foundations, columns, beams, slab upwards, door and window schedules, flooring, roofing, lintels, and parapets and roofing) and I will do the finishing myself, how much would this cost?
3. If you have done anything similar in the near past, how much did it cost you? What was your approach?
4. If I have a budget of 200M, can I expect to build this dream hose of mine? Or I am just dreaming?

Austrian writer/journalist seeking advice for respectful interviews about Rwandan healing culture,"Hi r/Rwanda,

I'm an Austrian writer/journalist writing about cultural healing practices worldwide. Rwanda is part of my 24-country book project journey to understand how different cultures process emotional pain and support each other.

Similarly to posts I made on other countries subreddits, I'm interested in learning about Gacaca reconciliation processes, Ubuntu healing principles, community healing practices, and how Rwandan culture approaches recovery and emotional wellbeing.

**I'd appreciate guidance on:**

* Cultural etiquette when requesting interviews with Rwandans?
* How to respectfully discuss healing and reconciliation topics?
* Appropriate behavior and respectful gestures?
* How to approach discussions of recovery and healing sensitively?
* Best places to meet people open to cultural conversations?
* Any specific protocols for discussing community healing?
* How to show proper respect for Rwandan resilience and values?

As a European, I want to ensure I approach this book project with maximum cultural sensitivity.

Malaria and taking Malarone pills,"Hi everyone,

  
I'm heading to Kigali for work soon and was wondering do I need to take Malarone pills? I'll be mostly indoors at the hotel and no where near water. I'm afraid of the side effects as I've read a lot about nightmares and abdominal pain and even diarrhea. ",2025-07-11 03:55:17
Your fellow expat here,"
As an expat with a demanding work routine, I've found it a bit challenging to socialize or make new friends. I’ve come to realize how valuable it is to have someone to unwind with, whether it’s a walk, a good conversation, or coffee.
If you relate, feel free to reach out. And even if you don’t, reach out anyway. Let’s connect.

I am a 30 yo old guy, if that matters..

Feedback – Cost of Living in Kigali (Rwanda) for a Single Westerner,"I'm sharing here my personal experience as a single Westerner who lived in **Kigali** for several years, with a clear and detailed overview of the **cost of living**. My only goal is to help you get a realistic picture, based on my own experience, with full transparency and without any pretension.

**1. Fixed monthly expenses (on average):**

* **Housing (private and full furnished house)**: €600 → Includes rent, electricity (without AC), wifi, guard, and maintenance -  prices vary depending on the client and also on the landlord... but roughly, the places I considered good were around €500-600 all-inclusive. However, lately, I have the feeling that prices have gone up to around €800–900.
* **Mobile internet & call**: €10
* **Groceries**: €100 → (Supermarkets like Simba, T2000, local markets for fruits, vegetables, and meat)
* **Transport**: €70 moto taxi
* **Other (subscriptions, miscellaneous plans)**: €20

**Total fixed expenses**: **€800 / month**

**2. Monthly leisure/personal expenses (on average):**

* **Vacations / Weekends**: €250 (averaged over the year)
* **Restaurants / Outings**: €100
* **Other leisure & personal purchases**: €150

**Total leisure expenses**: **€500 / month**

**Summary:** For my profile and lifestyle, I spent around **€1,300 per month**, including **€800 in fixed costs** and **€500 in leisure/personal expenses**.

If you need to manage your own transportation: private car : around €600/month rental or around €10,000 for decent purchase → + €150/month for fuel (excluding frequent repairs on older cars). Owning a car can be a major expense (most are old, break down often, and require costly maintenance).

**Comparison with local cost of living:**

* A **Rwandan daily worker** earning about **€70/month** typically rents a **single room with no kitchen for €18/month**
* A **skilled Rwandan** with an average salary of **€300–500/month** usually pays around **€150-200/month** for a basic room + kitchen.
* Someone earning between €1,500 and €3,000/month would typically rent a place in the €500 to €1,500, which corresponds to a very good standard of housing, more or less equivalent to Western standards.
* **Wealthy Rwandan** or **expats working for multinational companies**, earning over **€4,000/month**, often get very big housing provided, worth between **€1,500 and €5,000/month**, with many extra benefits included

Kigali offers a **wide range of lifestyles**. For a **single Westerner**, including leisure, transportation, and a few weekend trips, I recommend planning for **minimum around €900-1,300/month** **for single Westerner.**  
Of course, if you’re sharing accommodation, my estimate will be lowered by at least €300.

**Housing is relatively expensive** in Kigali, as well as cars, luxury tourism, and Western-style products.  
If you want to keep your budget low, you really need to **change your habits,** start by buying **local fruits and vegetables at the market**, and **avoid processed foods** similar to what you'd find in Western countries.  
Schooling for children also has a cost, as do subscriptions to various gyms or other activities.

**Share your thoughts and experiences as a Rwandan resident or a foreigner living in Kigali or elsewhere in Rwanda.**",2025-07-10 16:43:29

Is it realistic to find land that is this remote when living 15km outside of kigalis center.

It's probably quite similar for most larger cities,  but I've only ever lived close ro a 200k population city and not a few million like kigali.

"Paid for a full Nyungwe adventure, ended up doing nothing for 8 hours — thanks to poor planning and 24 harnesses for hundreds of people","It's now 7 PM I'm in the middle of Nyungwe, and I have done no activities in the park, not even a small hike. I have been here for 8 hours doing nothing. TL;DR at the bottom.

We booked a Nyungwe trip with Milimount Tours and paid in full on Monday. They told us to catch a 4 AM bus from Kigali today (Saturday), which we did. After a 6-hour ride, we arrived at Nyungwe National Park around 10 AM.

To our surprise, there were hundreds of people waiting for the zipline, but only 24 harnesses were available. After each group finishes the ride, porters have to hike ~5km round trip to bring the harnesses back. This causes a 2+ hour delay between groups. On top of that, if it rains, the zipline shuts down.

With this setup, only 3–4 small groups (under 100 people total) can ride the zipline per day.

We were supposed to do 3 zipline rides, a canopy walk, and a tea plantation visit — but we ended up doing none of it. After sitting in Nyungwe for 8 hours, the tour company gave us two bad options:

1. Do one zipline ride (not guaranteed) and get no refund.

2. Do nothing and get a refund.

Poor planning and communication from both Milimount Tours and Nyungwe Park made this an incredibly frustrating waste of a day.

**If you’ve got a bigger platform on Twitter or Instagram, feel free to repost — we just want the message to reach the right people.**

Update: We got a 20k refund which is not even half of what we paid for the trip, 65k

*TL;DR:*
Paid for full Nyungwe tour package with 3 zipline rides, canopy walk, and tea plantation. After a 6-hour trip, I waited 8 hours and did nothing due to massive overbooking, slow zipline logistics, and poor communication. The tour company offered either a 1 zipline ride (no refund) or a full refund (no activities). The whole day was wasted.",2025-07-05 17:22:38

Rwandair and lost baggage,"Why is Rwandair getting such bad notoriety with lost baggage? We flew from Dubai to Ghana and none of our bags came. 

Every one from Dubai to Ghana did not get a single bag. And we get comments that if we fly Rwandair we should not expect to get our bags. 

They are going to loose business. Unfortunately there were several travel agents on that flight! 

Update: the bags finally came in. It took four days to get them. I stayed in town all day but I did not get a call from lost luggage… I kept checking the arrival board … the flight was supposed to get in at 12:30 but as of 2:30 there was still no update so I went home around 5:30 I got the call that the bags are in so I had to get the passports and tags and went straight into traffic to the airport. 

Got the bags with some attitude from the lost baggage department but I was unfazed then customs also wanted to check the bags but I left the keys behind … I gave her permission and she broke into each bag in less than 30 seconds with just a pen (I think I get why people wrap their bags now)

 Anyway we  get home and the cheese, butter and chocolate have all melted in one suitcase and so that’s an almost write off if laundry does not work and it does not look like it. Anyway that is the end of my Rwandair luggage saga and my flying with Rwandair! Asante! ",2025-07-05 13:15:27

PSA: Avoid scam visa websites like rwandaimmigration.org – I lost $800!,"Just a heads up to fellow travelers – I recently got scammed out of $800 using the website https://www.rwandaimmigration.org, which looks official but is not affiliated with the Rwandan government. Please don’t use it.

The official site for Rwanda’s e-visa and travel services is:
https://irembo.gov.rw

Also worth noting:
	•	Rwanda is visa-free for many nationalities now, and you can get the East African Visa on arrival at the airport or land borders.
	•	These scammers are operating under similar fake domains for other countries too, like:
	•	kenyaimmigration.org
	•	tanzaniaimmigration.org
	•	ugandaimmigration.org
	•	And more…

They often appear high in search results and look very convincing, but they charge hundreds of dollars in hidden fees or never process your visa at all.

Urgent need a trustworthy Schengen Visa Agency for Portugal. Any recommendations !,"Hey folks,

I’m African and finally gearing up for that long-awaited trip to Portugal (or anywhere in Schengen, really). I’d love to hand off the visa legwork to a reliable agency,someone who answers emails promptly, is transparent about fees, and actually knows what they’re doing.

A few things I’m hoping for:

	•	Real track record: Agencies you’ve used that got your Schengen visa without drama.

	•	Solid support: Help with paperwork, booking appointments, follow-ups everything.

	•	Fair pricing: No surprise charges halfway through.

	•	Red flags: Any warning signs I should watch out for?

If you’ve had a smooth experience (or a horror story I can learn from!), please share or DM. Your insights could save me a lot of time and stress. 
Thanks so much!",2025-06-27 23:54:09

Kagame has disappeared again. The government is hiding the smoke,Kagame has again disappeared from life for 15 days straight. The #1 worrying sign is that the government has arrested a second time the only opposition leader left inside the country because they are worried she might be handed over power.  Social media is full of rumours of insider fighting within his own party. This also comes at a time when Rwanda is increasingly isolated internationally due its support of M23. With or without him the US brokered peace deal in the DRC is getting signed on 27th of June. Now they’ve announced a 6 days holiday in the first week of July!!! What is going on?? I’m sure many of his apologists in this sub have also started questioning whether Kagame is alive ,2025-06-23 11:10:06

- Whether international qualifications make a significant difference in pay?

Relocating soon,"Hey guys! Me and my fiancé got our first house in Rwanda, it’s a 4 bedroom and we’re excited. We’re in the process of furnishing it and we just had some questions…

1. Where’s the best place to buy a bed & sofa? Are there any websites? A few people mentioned some shops downtown but I prefer to browse on the website and if I like the look of something id go into store

2. Portable Air conditioning? We don’t want to install an AC unit just yet so we wanted a portable one for the time being, where can we find one and any rough estimate on how much one would be? We ideally want 2 (1 for living room, 1 for the master bedroom) 

3. Is it worth getting a generator? How often are power outages? Some say it’s often and some say it isn’t, we will be staying in kagarama if that’s useful 

4. We have a helper who is staying there at the moment, he was looking after the house and he’s well known in the area so we decided to keep him as he will be staying in the boys quarters. His role is to clean inside/outside and act as security, he asked for 50k a month and an additional 50k for food - is that too much? Some people said they pay theirs 30k, but I’m unsure. I don’t mind paying 50k but my fiancé says it’s a bit much seeing as he’s just cleaning. 

Hope you guys can help! Thanks in advance ",2025-06-22 06:56:22

Why is the highest banknote only 5k RWF (~$3.53 USD)? Why not develop and distribute higher-level banknotes?,"How much does it cost the national money printer to make each of the current banknotes? If it costs more than they're worth, perhaps it's time to make them into coins (if it'll be cheaper to mint them) and introduce bigger bills.

So why aren't there 10k (\~$7.07), 20k (\~$14.13), 50k (\~$35.33) and 100k (\~$70.37) RWF notes? Why stop at only 5k?

Hopefully it will be easy to wire-transfer my American money to a Rwandan Bank if I make it to Rwanda before World War III hits the first world. Because once the nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles hit, I have reason to believe that I will no longer be able to access my money Stateside remotely.

But I know tribal identities have been demolished and outlawed but I don’t know how enforced it is and if relationships between Tutsis and Hutus improved. I know these terms are arbitrary so I apologize if my mention is rude but my questions are 

1) Do people still identify differences in ethnicities despite the outlaw or are ethinic identities rendered ineffective ?

2) how common is intermarriage in between Hutus and Tutsis ?

3) Did people (mainly descendants of survivors) heal from the outcome of the past genocide ? Or do resentments and hate still exists ? 

4) Are discriminations still in any way present ?

5) what do you guys believe is the best way to breed understanding and alliances post ethnic conflict ?

Idea for Visiting Musunze / Ruhegiri / Twin Lakes,"The hotels at Lake Ruhondo and Lake Burera will take you around on boat tours, but if you want a INCREDIBLE authentic experience, I suggest you contact the locals.

A friend and I got lost and ended up paying local fisherman far less to show us around the lake, and then another local took us through local villages on the way back to the road. It was the best thing I did in Rwanda.

  
Reasons to give it a try:

1. That money actually goes to the local community instead of hotel conglomerates

2. The most beautiful part of Rwanda are the incredible villages scattered everywhere. Plus, interacting with local Rwandans around the Twin Lakes is amazing! They rarely see foreigners.

3. Way more authentic experience. If taking hotel boats, you might as well be anywhere else in the world.

  
If interested, I told this local man (25 years old, incredibly kind, working on his English) that I would post his number so others can have an amazing an experience as we had.

Visiting Rwanda in July - who wants a beer?,"My name’s Jon and I’m going to be visiting Rwanda in mid-July to early August. I’m an aspiring photojournalist / documentary film maker, and while my main goal of my visit is to take in your beautiful country and meet some lovely people, I would also like to explore the politics of the region in some way. East African politics interests me a lot, as I see many parallels to the state of affairs we have here in Europe. More similarities than many appreciate. 

So I guess this post is a request - if anyone is involved in Rwandan journalism or politics in any way, or even just likes to keep up with current affairs in Rwanda and feels they have a strong interest or opinions about the politics of your country, I would really love to get in contact over message and/or perhaps meet up if possible when I visit. I’ve seen a few posts on here talking about how politics is NOT spoken about in Rwandan life so I need to understand how to respect this if so, and I would love to hear any insights on how true this is (e.g. if it affects discussions about *anything* political, or just conversations related to 1994 etc.)

Please drop me a message on here if this sounds interesting to you I would love to hear from you. Even if it’s nothing politics related and you just want to recommend something or grab a beer in July, get in touch!

Thanks, Jon ",2025-05-29 12:03:25

Need Advice – Unexpected Legal Fee After Father's Death,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping to get some guidance on a situation I’m dealing with in Rwanda.

My father passed away recently in Rwanda while receiving treatment at a hospital. There was an outstanding hospital bill, and a local law firm offered to help us so we could pay the bill using funds from my father's bank account there.

The lawyers offered to help by contacting the bank and hospital, gathering the necessary documents, and drafting a letter to the bank requesting they release the payment to the hospital. I provided them with documents like my passport, birth certificate, my father's will, and ID for my siblings.

They carried out the task, and the bank paid the hospital directly. Initially the solicitor had a verbal agreement with my late fathers ex-boss/friend (who is local) that he would pick up the bill. However, for some unknown they didn't bill him for this.

Now ive come to Rwanda to sort some things out, it's been 4 months later and they have sent me a letter demanding $3,000+taxes USD in legal fees. This was the first time any fee was mentioned—there was no prior agreement, no engagement letter, and no quote.

I feel taken advantage of, especially as I was grieving, overseas, and unfamiliar with the local legal system. I've asked for a breakdown and plan to dispute the fee. I’ve also contacted a UK solicitor for advice.

To complicate things, I believe one of the lawyers may have held a senior position in the Rwanda Bar Association.

My only other option is to contact the British Embassy as a UK citizen?

Has anyone experienced anything similar, or can offer advice on how to handle this kind of situation?

Thanks in advance.

Transport from Kigali to Volcanoes National Park,"I am travelling to Rwanda later this year with my wife, specifically to go Gorilla Trekking. I understand about the permits and how to book: my question relates to transport between Kigali and the National Park. I have researched enough to understand that I can book a day tour where they will pick us up in Kigali early (4:30am), take us the gorilla trekking and return us in the afternoon but I found all these tours to be quite expensive, especially for two of us. Yes, they provide some breakfast and a bottle of water but it seems like it is really just transport. I am considering hiring a car and driving. In that instance I would drive up one day and overnight near the National Park, do the trek the next morning and drive back to Kigali that afternoon. Hire cars seem cheap but I am unsure about the drive. Any advice on my options and how easy it is to drive up to the National Park would be appreciated.",2025-05-27 06:11:09

2. What are the average land prices per square meter in both central and suburban areas?
3. Is it common for foreigners to face inflated pricing, and how can one ensure they are being charged a fair market rate and not taken advantage off?
4. What are the typical legal and administrative steps to verify land ownership and ensure there are no disputes or encumbrances?

V12 long term visitor visa - any info?,"Hi everyone, I've been considering applying for the V12 visa since I'll be visiting Rwanda a lot these coming years (my partner is Rwandan).

Denial of UN Reports?,"I often hear from Rwandans that there is no proof that the RDF is in Congo, that the conflict in Congo has nothing to do with Rwanda, and I wanted to know if Rwandan civilians are actually made to ignore UN reports that directly prove the Rwandan army’s presence in DRC. Do Rwandan civilians actually believe their government over independent, third party, UN reports? Do Rwandans really believe that everyone is lying except for their government? 

Every single year since 2004 the United Nations writes reports on the state of the DRC conflict using neutral investigators with no connection to any parties (the 2021 report, for example, was investigated by independent experts from Kenya, France, Colombia, Benin, Belgium, and the UK— nobody from DRC or Rwanda itself), and the most recent reports include the following:

“40. The Group obtained further evidence - authenticated photographs, drone footage, video recordings, testimony and intelligence - confirming systematic border incursions by RDF and its reinforced presence in Petit Nord, with RDF matching, if not surpassing, M23 in numbers (see paras. 37 and 43). RDF positioned itself at the frontlines, operated high-tech weaponry and directly engaged in combat. Its presence was critical in repelling joint FARDC-Wazalendo offensives and occupying new territories in Petit Nord (see annex 27). 

41. In January 2024, at least 1,000 RDF troops entered the Democratic Republic of the Congo through various border crossings east of Kibumba, Rutshuru territory, and were deployed to key military positions. Following this reinforcement, on 3 February, RDF and M23 took control of Shasha, a village with strategic access to Lake Kivu. RDF maintained combat positions on the hills around Sake, which it still occupied at the time of drafting. In early April 2023, RDF took control of three vacated MONUSCO positions north-west of Sake (see annex 28). At the time of drafting, 500 RDF and 500 M23 combatants, the latter commanded by the sanctioned individuals Baudoin Ngaguye (CDi.019) and Bernard Byamungu (CDi.038) and Julien Mahano Baratuje, controlled the areas north, west and south of Sake.”

What are the drone laws in Rwanda for hobbyist/educational use? (Not for commercial purposes),"Hi everyone,

I'm a software engineer and IoT hobbyist planning to dive into drone development. My goal is to design and build drones from scratch  including creating circuits, programming flight control, and even 3D printing parts and frames. This is purely for **learning and educational purposes**, not for any commercial activity like photography, delivery, or surveillance.

All of this will be done **at home**, and I’ll need to **test the drones regularly** in that setting.

I wanted to ask:

* What does the law in **Rwanda** say about drone use for **personal, non-commercial, or educational** purposes?
* Are there any **maximum altitude limits** or **design restrictions**?
* Do I need to **register** my drone or get a **license**, even for **home-made drones** tested in **non-public areas**?
* Are there any **exceptions** or **allowances** for hobbyists, students, or educational drone projects?
* Any insights from people who’ve done similar projects locally?

If anyone has **first-hand experience**, I’d really appreciate your input. I want to make sure I’m compliant with the rules before I begin any serious testing.

Thanks in advance!",2025-05-09 11:11:20

A scammer will list the same thing (copy pictures and descriptions) for 500K RWF.



If you see two things with one costing less, it's easy to say the price is a factor, and you are very likely to engage in conversation with the listing with the lower price.



You chat and bring down the prices from 500K to 350k and agree on getting the item.

The scammer likely will ask you for location and when you say in Kigali and ask where they are based, they will say like in Nyamata somewhere (it is an example). But here is the thing they are scammers and claim they do free delivery anywhere in Kigali (that's the catch). 

You are probably left with two options:

1. Chat about how they can deliver

2. Ask them the exact address and come pick them up.

If you go with option 1, they will insist that you pay half the price and pay the rest after deliver.

Ask you may guess, whatever you pay there you are ripped off. They were never real in the first place.

If you choose option 2. They will keep insisting on delivery and if you don't agree they cut the connection or ignore your calls or messages since they have no other means of getting your money.



This is a real observation of someone who regularly buys on the Facebook marketplace.

That is just one way but there are so many ways they do it.



What can you do in those situations?!

Maybe:

\- Always demand to get their exact address so you can check the items.

\- Or ask for payment on delivery. I mean pay 100% only when you receive the items.

Or just buy from known shops, and sellers.



Just be aware there are a lot of scams happening there and be vigilant.



**Disclaimer:** Not all listings are scams and a listing being cheap doesn't mean its a scam. There are many honest and legit sellers on Facebook Marketplace. This post is just a heads-up based on common patterns I've noticed.",2025-05-01 12:58:00

Renting a Car in Kigali? Here's Some Local Advice from Someone Who Lives Here,"Hey everyone,

I see a lot of travelers asking about car rentals in Kigali, so I thought I'd share some local advice. I'm based here and run a small rental company, so hopefully this helps!

- Driving in Kigali is pretty smooth — roads are in good condition, and people are generally respectful drivers. Just be ready for lots of motorbikes and hidden speed bumps!

- Insurance is really important. Even if you’re a careful driver, unexpected things can happen, so make sure you’re fully covered.

- Self-drive or driver? If you’re new to Africa, sometimes having a local driver (even just for the first day) makes things way easier. After that, self-driving is fine!

I started Platinumwheels Rentals to make it easier (and cheaper) for travelers to get around. We have small cars and SUVs, available for self-drive or with a driver, plus 24/7 support if anything comes up.

If you have any questions about driving here, the best road trips outside Kigali, or renting tips in general, feel free to ask! Happy to share what I know.

Enjoy your trip to Rwanda — it’s an amazing country!",2025-04-30 13:29:28

Why Are We Still So Dependent on Foreign Aid in 2025?,"I'm Kenyan-Rwandan, proud of how far we've come—but I'm also deeply concerned. It's 2025, and despite the flashy Kigali skyline and all the international praise we get, we are still heavily dependent on foreign aid. Some reports say nearly 40% of our national budget comes from donors. Isn't it time we questioned this model?

Where’s the real economic independence? We're building convention centers and smart cities, but most rural areas still lack proper access to healthcare, quality education, or electricity. The leadership boasts about being ""self-reliant,"" but how self-reliant can we be when a cut in donor funding could crash entire programs?

I get that aid helped us recover post-genocide, but are we using it as a crutch now? Why aren't we investing more in agriculture, small industries, and local innovation instead of relying on foreign-funded NGOs to do basic development work?

Not trying to hate—just genuinely asking: Is our development sustainable, or just well-managed dependency?

The Effects of The Genocide Still Run Deep,"I was born after the Genocide, so I never fully understood how much it affected people. I was having a small row with my parent, and after a very long and deep conversation, I realized she’s still living in survival mode. All of her decisions and relationships are influenced by what happened to her during that period.

Her family left her during the Genocide, and she had to fend for herself. While she won’t admit it publicly, she’s still very much afraid that it could happen again, no matter how many people surround her. This is where it gets even more dangerous, because like a domino effect, parents (unwillingly) transfer that trauma to their children, which to some extent impacts their lives and starts a vicious cycle.",2025-04-26 19:53:03

Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.


The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.

What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)

I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.",2025-04-20 14:53:05

# There’s hardly a need to explain who Moses Turahirwa is—or to introduce his brand, Moshions. Many of us have worn it, or at least admired it. Personally, I only own one shirt from the label. But let’s be honest—Moshions wasn’t just a fashion brand; it became a cultural symbol. It took off in a way few Rwandan brands ever have, gracing the wardrobes of none other than the President of Rwanda, the First Lady, and even the First Daughter. That level of endorsement alone elevated Moshions far beyond what any runway or press release could do.



# It was a perfect blend: Moses’ undeniable talent and Rwanda’s soft power. Together, they propelled him to global heights—heights he could never have reached on his own.



# Then came the scandal.



# Moses was arrested and held for 76 days after publicly displaying a fake Rwandan passport, claiming a new identity as a woman—allegedly with the blessing of His Excellency, President Paul Kagame. At the time of his arrest, he had over $2 million in legally-earned income. That alone shows just how successful he had become within the very system he now turns his back on.



# Today, Moses has made it clear—he despises Kagame, the Inkotanyi, and everything they stand for. And he chose cyunamo, a sacred time of national mourning, to make his statement. That’s not activism. That’s provocation.



# And before you try to spin this as Rwanda being “anti-gay,” let’s cut that nonsense right here. It’s not illegal to be gay in Rwanda. Nobody is persecuted for that. Side note: I’m flying to Japan in July for a gay wedding—that’s how little it means to us. No one cares. It’s not about who you love—it’s about how you conduct yourself.



# Also—let’s not forget when your dog was tragically killed. Who stepped in to protect you? The same government you now insult. Be honest with yourself: if they hadn’t intervened that day, what do you think would’ve happened? Those guys wouldn’t have stopped at your dog. They would’ve broken your neck too.



# Moses, someone sent you. They sent you a long time ago. And the truth is, many people saw it. But they gave you the benefit of the doubt.

I wonder if it’s just me or anyone else had a similar encounter,"So, I reached out with this person 29 years after a close relationship and friendship. This person is a Belgian who lived in my village before 1994. She had a girl of my age and we were very close, she had sleepovers in each-others homes and we basically were inseparable until they left the place shortly before the genocide. Our hearts were broken, we thought we would never hear of each other. In 2009 I moved to Kenya and learned the charity this lady was working for was there. I asked around and finally got in contact with the daughter. It was a “happy reunion” on the phone until I suggested to meet up. My friend tried to hide it but I finally realized she just didn’t want to meet me. First forward, I moved to Canada and on my way from visiting my family in Rwanda I stopped in Netherland and planned to go to Belgium to visit the Mother. I assumed she would be so happy to see me and hear all that happened to us after they left. On the picture is her reply. 

I didn’t think much of it until I talked to my mom and told her what happened and she said, “what were you thinking, Belgians who were in Rwanda  think Tutsi are the bad people in the whole genocide thing”. I didn’t understand until the news about Rwanda cutting ties with Belgium. Now I wonder if anyone else has been in the same situation. ",2025-04-11 18:35:21

Kigali’s geography is funny!,"Born and raised in Kigali and I never cared much about the geography until i traveled. I mean it’s quite common that big cities and metropolitans are built on flat surfaces or valleys. I lived in Berlin for a year and I could ride on a flat road for 50+ miles. In Kigali, good luck finding such road or surface lol. It’s hills and mountains everywhere, explains why everyone is athletic. Downtown Kigali is actually the steepest downtown i’ve ever seen anywhere :)) Regardless of the geography however, we really found a way to make it the most beautiful city. Most unique city really.

Would a dedicated e-commerce platform for Rwandan artisans work? Looking for feedback!,"I’m thinking of building a **platform** to help local artisans sell handmade products online. Many struggle to reach customers beyond their community, and some don’t have the tech skills or devices to list their products.  
I’ve spoken to a few local artisans (not many), and they said they’d love to sell online but don’t know how or lack the right tools.

The idea:

* A simple e-commerce platform for artisans.
* Easy product uploads & secure payments.
* Delivery support.
* A **low-scale solution** where we visit artisans to help upload products if they lack access.

Does this solve a real gap, or are there existing solutions? Would artisans use it? What challenges do you see?",2025-04-01 15:20:53

Tippu Tip in Rwanda,"(Long story, but I hope you'll understand why)
Can you recommend me a book or website on the influence of Tippu Tip in Rwanda? French or English preferred, but other languages are welcome.
I was born in Rwanda in 1988, but didn't grow up there as we left in 1990 to go to a West African country. My parents are very fluent in Kinyarwanda and have even been described by someone of their friends to be very ""Rwandophone"".
So I grew up always thinking that I have parents that are 100% Rwandan and it must have been the case for generations. For my dad, I think that it must be true. I managed to trace down the name of his clan and sub-clan. The name of his sub-clan (as one cousin from his side described it) appeared on a report from 1933 that was made by a Belgian who was sent to do a research in that part of the country (Nyaruguru). 
But for my mother side, it's a complete dead end. She has no idea about what clan she is from. Says that she was not taught anything about it. But growing up in West Africa, many of the locals thought that she was from the north. Part of the Hausa population. Something that we always denied of course. 
Now we are in Europe and even Moroccan merchants, are talking to her as if she's from the Amazigh/Berber population. And again we denied it.
I happened to travel to Morocco in 2022 and what do I get? Local merchants asking me to confirm that I'm not an Amizigh/Berber ( I look more like her). Even Amazighs were talking to me in their local language at first. Then it occurred to me that many of my Rwandan friends always told me that they never thought of me as Rwandan, until they heard my parents speak Kinyarwanda. Most of them thought Somali, Eritrea or some mix from the Caribbean.

Now one of my brothers (looks more like our father) made a Heritage DNA test and it came out as 90% Bantu (east and West). I definitely expected this. But also 4% Middle Eastern, 4% Italian and 2% Eastern Europe (Balkan region). 
I got me thinking, how does a DNA like that end up in (Pre-colonial) Rwanda?
No grand parents or older generation in her side of the family to ask about it unfortunately. And I doubt that a Moroccan got lost in ancient times and ended up in that part of Africa. 

So I'd like to investigate the influence of Tippu Tip in Rwanda to see if this could give me an explanation. I know he had a lot of influence in Eastern Congo and was part Oman. Could any of his ""associates"" get offsprings that crossed the border and ended up in Pre-colonial Rwanda?",2025-03-31 06:51:24

Need help dealing with Rwandan bank?,"Hi I was hoping someone could give me some help regarding this matter.

My father passed away in January in Rwanda. He was a UK citizen but he would spend alot of time in Rwanda. He had savings in a Rwandan bank account which we are having difficulty transferring to the UK as instructed in my late fathers will.

I’m facing a problem with document certification. The bank requires physical copies of my father’s will and the beneficiaries' passports, all certified by the Rwandan High Commission in London.

However, the Rwandan High Commission UK only provides digital certifications and no longer issues physical versions!! Despite submitting the digitally certified documents, the bank refuses to proceed, insisting on physical copies.

This has left me stuck, as I can’t obtain physical certifications under the High Commission’s current policy. I’ve contacted the bank, but they won’t accept the digital versions. Apprently this is referred to as bureaucratic deadlock.

I’m now considering reaching out to the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINAFFET) for guidance.

1986 Lake Nyos(Cameroon) had a limnic eruption releasing large amounts of CO2 and suffocated all living things within 30km radius. Lake Kivu has a similar buildup!,"A pocket of magma lies beneath the lake and leaks carbon dioxide (CO2) into the water, changing it into carbonic acid. After the explosion 1700 people and their livestock perished.Lake Kivu(Rwanda,DRC) has a similar carbon dioxide buildup and it’s a matter of time before its own eruption. Unlike in Cameroon more than 10 million people live on the shores of Lake Kivu. The French installed a degassing system to safely release the gas on lake Nyos and lake Manon. The Kivu degassing operation will be bigger and more complex but it was due ten years ago! ",2025-03-21 06:45:45

Help in understanding the entire situation in the Congo,"Hello guys. I need some help. I have been following the whole DRC crisis for some time now. (My father was a Zimbabwean soldier who fought in the war way back in the 90s). I am having a lot of difficulty understanding the whole Banyamulenge and Banyarwanda distinction. From what I have read so far, Banyarwanda seems to refer to all Congolese of Rwandan origin. They speak Kinyarwanda, make up about 50% of the North Kivu population, and are majority Hutu with a sizeable Tutsi minority and a smaller portion of Twa. The Banyamulenge are a sub-group of the Banyarwanda that are of Tutsi origin. They are mostly found in the Mulenge Area of South Kivu and speak Kinyamulenge which is a dialect of Kinyarwanda. 

As I understand it, the Congolese seem to consider the Banyamulenge as foreigners. Does this also extend to the Banyarwanda or its only the Banyamulenge that are targetted? And if so, why exactly is that?",2025-03-20 06:02:29

HEAR ME OUT as a concerned rwandan with families in both kivu provinces,"
Recent developments in the Congo crisis, including the talks between Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi in Qatar, have led to an agreement on a ceasefire. It is rumored that the leaders of the Alliance of Democratic Forces AFC/M23 rebel group may soon meet with President Tshisekedi in Qatar as well. This raises an interesting possibility: what if Rwanda agrees to sever ties with AFC/M23, halt all funding, and even withdraw all alleged troops from Congolese territory, but the AFC/M23 leadership refuses to stand down?
Given that AFC/M23 now controls a significant portion of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)—an area reportedly twice the size of Rwanda itself and rich in mineral resources—it is conceivable that they could sustain their operations independently. With so much at stake, it seems unlikely that they would readily surrender, even if Rwanda withdraws its support or the Congolese government offers promises of peace and integration into the national army.
Several questions emerge from this scenario. Might AFC/M23 demand autonomy for the territory they currently control? If President Tshisekedi urges them to disarm, what incentives could he offer in exchange, especially considering their demonstrated resolve and battlefield successes against his forces? Tshisekedi’s initial reluctance to negotiate with AFC/M23, followed by his recent request for talks, suggests he recognizes their strength and may fear their capabilities. 
This situation presents no straightforward resolution. Will eastern DRC ultimately gain autonomy, or will AFC/M23 yield to diplomatic pressure? The path forward remains uncertain, with significant implications for the region’s stability and resource control.",2025-03-19 09:38:04

* **Rent (1 bedroom apartment or similar)**
* **Food (groceries and eating out sometimes)**
* **Transportation (public transport, moto taxis, etc.)**

President Tshisekedi's Decision to Engage with M23 Rebels Amid SADC Withdrawal and U.S. Mineral Negotiations: A Turning Point for the DRC?,"In a significant shift in policy, President Félix Tshisekedi has agreed to participate in direct peace talks with the M23 rebel group, with Angola mediating the discussions set to commence on March 18 in Luanda, the day of my birthday actually😂. This development comes as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) announces a phased withdrawal of its troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), raising concerns about the nation's capacity to manage rebel threats independently. 

Simultaneously, reports indicate that the DRC is negotiating a minerals-for-security agreement with the United States, potentially granting American companies exclusive access to critical minerals in exchange for military assistance against the M23 insurgency. 

These concurrent developments present a complex dilemma for the DRC's future. On one hand, engaging in direct talks with M23 could pave the way for a peaceful resolution to years of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern regions. On the other hand, the withdrawal of SADC forces might leave a security vacuum that could be exploited by various armed groups. Furthermore, while the proposed deal with the U.S. could bolster the DRC's military capabilities, it raises questions about sovereignty and the long-term implications of granting foreign entities significant control over the nation's natural resources.

As these events unfold, the path ahead for the DRC remains uncertain. The outcomes of the upcoming peace talks and the potential U.S. partnership will undoubtedly have profound impacts on the nation's stability and its control over valuable mineral assets. The international community watches closely, hopeful for a resolution that ensures peace, sovereignty, and prosperity for the Congolese people. Especially the Banyamulenge people suffering a lot due to these conflicts. 

What are your thoughts on President Tshisekedi's recent moves? Do you believe these strategies will lead to lasting peace and stability in the DRC, or do they pose risks that could further complicate the nation's future?",2025-03-14 12:36:40

This Rwanda being a tool for the West makes 0 sense to me,"I am not Rwandan/Congolese but I’ve been following this conflict and the arguments. This idea that Rwanda and M23 exist to funnel Congolese resources to the West makes 0 sense to me. First of all the smuggling of minerals from Congo to Rwanda would exist with or without M23, for example M23 financed itself early on not by taking control of mines but by taxing the already existing smuggling routes. Why would Rwanda incriminate themselves in this way for no reason when that was already going on fine?

The spike in smuggling from Congo to Rwanda really started after the U.S. passed Dodd Frank. A law that placed extreme regulations on minerals obtained from conflict-zones, this was an attempt to curb the funding of the conflict, but it instead just decimated Congo’s mining sector, which led to US companies simply choosing to not do work in Congo, they instead switched to Rwanda because it also had coltan and had developed traceability systems for its minerals, something Congo didn’t do, and even if they did probably would not have fixed their situation due to corruption. This happened in 2010, meaning the reason the West isn’t in Congo, isn’t because it doesn’t want to or is unable to access its resources due to the Congolese government. So, why prop up Rwanda if they’re feening so much for Congo’s resources? They could just repeal such laws and implement similar deals to what the Chinese are doing.

The Chinese own a stake in 70% of the mines in the DRC, this is due the collapse in the legal mining sector in the DRC following Dodd Frank. The Chinese do not have such laws and while they would prefer to ethically source their minerals, they are not losing sleep over this. So you would think the story goes, China dominates DRC’s mining sector and Rwanda serves the West by being a transit for smuggled Congolese mineral they need, right? WRONG.

The West depends more on China for coltan, and China has the largest control of the supply chain. Around, 70%+ of coltan exported from Rwanda in 2023 went to China, around 60% of all exports from Rwanda to China, excluding other minerals, is Coltan. Most of the West gets its Coltan after it is processed from China and it is shipped to Western countries. Like I said, China controls the entire supply chain, owning most of the mines in DRC and importing most of coltan in Congo and Rwanda to be used in its own processing plants. Rwanda’s exports to China alone was worth more than its export to Europe and the U.S. in 2023. And this is excluding other Asian countries. 

The vast majority of Rwanda’s exports then you would think to the west is of Coltan. Nope that is not the case, the vast majority of Rwanda’s exports to the West are agricultural, things like Coffee, Tea, legumes, vegetables. Rwanda’s biggest export partner is UAE, which took in like 100% of Rwanda’s Gold in 2023. Gold accounted for 65% of Rwanda’s exports and Coltan 7.5%, maybe less. 

Which begs the question, why is the chosen narrative that Rwanda is a tool for the West? To me, at this point it feels like a convenient scapegoat. If anything it makes more sense to say Rwanda is a tool for the UAE or China, but those simply do not hit/resonate as hard given Congo’s history of colonialism, and if I was the DRC it’s simply not smart to incriminate your biggest economic ally, being China. 

Overall, Rwanda’s economy is very much non-dependent on Coltan, and whatever Coltan they have is not sent to the West. In fact in 2023 Rwanda exported more Coltan to South Africa than all of Europe, $210 worth, thus it makes 0 sense that Rwanda would engage militarily for the sake of securing minerals for a Western power. At this point for me, that narrative makes 0 sense to me.

One of the reasons most of the products we consume in Rwanda are imported is because of our lack of value adding initiatives. For context, an example of a value adding job is taking crops residue or manure to produce organic fertilizer. This fertilizer can be sold to local farmers or sold abroad to bring in foreign currencies. On the opposite end, a non (or little) value adding activity is being a house broker or buying clothes in Dubai and selling them in Kigali. This type of activity puts a lot of pressure on the Rwandan Franc. The latter requires the Rwandan businessman to take out US Dollars from a local bank, taking that cash to Dubai, bringing those clothes he bought in Dollars to Rwanda and selling them in Rwandan Francs.

  
Question now is how can we get out of this cycle of having everyone venture into this type of activity? How can we as a society or the government encourage people to engage in more value adding activities and businesses?",2025-03-08 21:37:15

Parts of other nations were stated such as Uganda and Burundi but the Congo portion is the one that resounds strongly given current events.

Depression,"Hi, 
Muraho.

I’m a 32-year-old Rwandan, but currently I  live in Europe. I was raised in a poor farming family, and my father was very abusive. He insulted me and my siblings with all sorts of disrespectful words. He’s a very loud,  disrespectful man. When I finished high school, I was still living with him and my mother. He continued to abuse and insult me, so I had to move in with a high school friend. I lived there for 10 years until I went abroad to study. I am the youngest of eight siblings, and everyone has their fair share of trauma and abuse from our father.

Now, I have a job, I’m doing well, and I help support my family. However, I still carry the memories of that trauma, and apparently, I’ve never truly forgiven him. What surprises me is how my father is completely unaware of his abuse. Is this a disease? Whenever I talk about him and his behavior, he defends himself, as if he’s a victim. I don’t like it, and it makes me sad. I want an open discussion about this and an apology. It’ll never come apparently. 

Also, every time he calls me, my mood changes, and I lose control. At times, when I think about it, I feel extremely angry and upset. I also have depression. I don’t drink alcohol, no drugs, or anything like that; however, I feel like this experience has ruined my life.

So, what should I do to heal completely? Please advise me.

In case you have not seen this.


« It is astonishing to see so many analyses locked into the exclusive vilification of small Rwanda, ignoring other crucial realities. »

Here the full text in English (AI translation)


Crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: We Must Face the Situation Head-On




In the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), events are unfolding rapidly. The cities of Goma and Bukavu have been taken by the M23 rebellion, which is composed mostly (but not exclusively) of Rwandophone Congolese and is acting with the support of Rwanda. 

Immediately, a simplistic narrative emerged, portraying the situation as an aggression by Rwandan Tutsis against the Congo.
Kigali's intervention, often described as the mastermind of the operation, is frequently attributed to the sole motivation of ""plundering Congo’s mineral wealth."" However, the coltan mine in Rubaya, seized by M23 rebels in 2024, generates an estimated $300,000 per month, according to the UN—a minuscule sum compared to Rwanda’s resources and the mining royalties paid by Western and Chinese companies to the DRC, which, according to the IMF, officially amounted to approximately $1 billion in 2024.


Yet, the verdict has already been passed. It is astonishing to see so many analyses locked into the exclusive vilification of small Rwanda, ignoring other crucial realities.
A History of Discrimination and Violence
To fully understand the situation, one must consider the history of Congo, a vast country constructed through Belgian colonization and later trapped in tribalism. In Kivu, since the 1960s, Rwandophone populations have faced recurring political and social discrimination. In 1993, all Banyarwanda in North Kivu (both Tutsi and Hutu) became victims of massacres. Among them were descendants of migrant workers brought from Rwanda during colonization, Rwandan refugees from the 1960s, and even longstanding Rwandophone communities (the Banyamulenge), who had lived there for generations—just as Francophone Walloons are at home in Liège.


Anti-Tutsi Sentiment: The Equivalent of Antisemitism
In South Kivu, tens of thousands of Banyamulenge suffered systematic pogroms starting in 1994, following the Rwandan Tutsi genocide. Defeated genocidal troops and militias crossed into the DRC, driven by the same hatred that had led them to massacre nearly a million fellow citizens. Once across the colonial-era border, they targeted Congolese Tutsis in the same systematic manner.
Let’s not forget that in the aftermath of the Rwandan Tutsi genocide, orders from Paris allowed the Rwandan Armed Forces and genocidal militias to find refuge in Zaire (later renamed the DRC) with total impunity. These ruthless killers never truly abandoned their campaign of violence across the region, even crossing into Burundi to attack the Gatumba refugee camp, where 150 people were killed and 106 wounded on August 14, 2004.


Since 2000, these forces have operated under the name Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), continuing their reign of terror in Kivu for over three decades.
Meanwhile, racist propaganda has flourished, depicting Tutsis as ""Nilotics"" and perpetuating the myth that both Rwandan and Congolese Tutsis are ""foreigners"" who supposedly migrated from the Nile region. This rhetoric mirrors the extremist Rwandan media narratives of the early 1990s.

Tragically, even today, calls for a ""final solution"" against all Tutsis in the Great Lakes region persist on social media.
""They should find their way to Rwanda while they still can, [...] or else their bodies will be turned into compost to fertilize the land,"" declared Maï-Maï leader Jean-Baptiste Serugo on X.
Justice Minister Constant Mutamba has repeatedly denounced the presence of ""infiltrators,"" explicitly referring to Congolese Tutsis as mere instruments of Rwanda—just as Rwandan Tutsis were once accused of being ""ibitso"" (accomplices) of a rebellion in early 1990s Rwanda. We know where that rhetoric led.

A Convenient Scapegoat for the Congolese Government
These threats and recurring persecutions led to the emergence of the March 23 Movement (M23). Created by dissident officers of the Congolese army, this self-defense group briefly seized Goma in 2012. At the time, Kinshasa promised to integrate them into the Congolese army and dismantle the FDLR. However, instead of fulfilling these commitments, President Félix Tshisekedi—who took office in 2019—revived anti-Tutsi xenophobic rhetoric to bolster his popularity amid rampant corruption.
Recently, Swiss parliamentarians expressed outrage upon learning that President Tshisekedi’s delegation had spent 444,000 Swiss francs on luxury accommodations during the Davos Economic Forum, at the same time the Swiss parliament was approving an additional three million Swiss francs in aid for suffering Congolese civilians. When these revelations surfaced, the Congolese Minister of Communication blamed the leak on “Rwandan poison”—because from Kinshasa’s perspective, Rwanda is responsible for everything.


President Tshisekedi has found a scapegoat. He has mobilized the FDLR, along with a coalition of Wazalendo (“patriots”) from various armed groups. He has secured reinforcements from approximately 10,000 Burundian soldiers and a regional force dominated by South Africans, in addition to 1,600 highly paid Franco-Romanian mercenaries.


On December 19, 2023, preparing to assemble what seemed to be an invincible force, he declared:
""As soon as the first bullet is fired by those fools, I will convene Parliament to request authorization to declare war on Rwanda.""
We all know what happened next: his regime’s mismanagement led to military collapse and the desperate retreat of various militias.

A Manufactured Crisis?

Is the chaos in eastern DRC truly due to the M23’s attacks, or is it the result of years of militia rule—rife with extortion, rape, and murder?
The crisis is said to have caused ""20 million deaths"", a staggering and questionable figure. Yet, rappers and activists calling to ""free Congo"" draw simplistic parallels, equating ""Kagame with the swastika.""
As a result, the genocide of Rwandan Tutsis is downplayed, forgotten, or even denied. Whether labeled ""Rwandophones"" or ""Swahiliphones,"" the Tutsis remain the primary targets of extermination in Kinshasa and across the DRC.

Congolese bishops recently expressed alarm over the rising number of lynchings targeting so-called ""Rwandans"", who are in reality Congolese Tutsis persecuted because of their ethnicity.

Ignoring the Warning Signs
As in 1994, we must raise awareness about the growing dangers of blind hatred and mass violence.

Could What Happened to Gaddafi Happen to Kagame?,"I was very young when Gaddafi was killed, so I only know bits and pieces from threads I’ve read. Looking at Libya then vs. now, I think he was a great leader for Libya and Africa in general. He used oil wealth to improve the country, pushed for African unity, and didn’t bow down to Western powers. But at the same time, he was accused of supporting rebels, being a dictator, and eliminating political opponents.

This got me thinking about President Paul Kagame. I admire his stubbornness toward the West he doesn’t just do as they say, which I respect. But that also makes me wonder… could the same thing happen to him? The West has a history of turning against African leaders who don’t follow their agenda. Kagame has made Rwanda stable and developed, but if things ever turned against him, would Rwanda be strong enough to avoid chaos like Libya?

2. If there are no bundles that cover calls to a german number, what is the rate (FRW/min) for MTN? I found this website but it seems like the info is incomplete?

3. If I were the one to call (so incoming call from USA phone number to a Rwandan number) is it free to receive an international incoming call? for airtel? for MTN?

4. If incoming international calls are not free to receive for airtel or MTN, what are the rates to receive these calls? Does the rate differ for airtel and MTN?

Rwanda’s Rapid Rise: Real Development or Just Smart PR?,"Rwanda has seen remarkable economic growth since 1994, with new businesses and industries emerging. A smartphone factory, a growing fintech sector, and major infrastructure projects like the Kigali Innovation City highlight its ambitions. The country is praised for its governance and investment climate, yet critics point to state control, inequality, and heavy reliance on aid.
I read that the reason the west is ignoring rwanda's incursion into congo is their guilt of sitting idle during genocide period and because foreign aid actually transforms into actual development on the ground

Can people of Rwanda tell me that Is Rwanda’s growth a true success story driven by strong policies and innovation, or is it partly a result of good branding and external support? What are the key factors behind its rise?

TL;DR: Rwanda is growing fast, with industries like smartphone manufacturing and fintech taking off. Is this genuine development or just smart PR?

"According to various witnesses, the French actively cooperated with the Interahamwe and the Hutu-led government","French General Jean Varret was head of the military cooperation mission at the French Ministry of Cooperation during this period. In his book *Général, j’en ai pris pour mon grade*, he recounts that he resigned from the French army in 1993, before the Tutsi genocide, because the general staff had dismissed his warnings about the strategy being pursued in Rwanda.

Let’s return to ethnic identity cards. They were systematically checked at numerous roadblocks during the 1990-1994 period to track down Tutsis. The perverse effect of these ethnic identity cards was clearly integrated into the French strategy. Not only did Rwandans check these ethnic identity cards, but so did French soldiers. For example, in 1998, Yvonne Mutimura-Galinier recounted in *Libération,* that she was subjected to an ethnic check by the French in 1993:

 **In February 1993, after the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) launched another attack, security checks were tightened. At roadblocks near Kigali, both French and Rwandan flags were displayed. French soldiers were inspecting identity papers, specifically checking people's ethnicity and origins. One day, about 15 kilometers from Kigali, I was traveling with my sister and sister-in-law when we reached a roadblock manned by French soldiers.** 

**They stopped us and said, ""Show your papers."" We questioned them: ""Why are you checking us? This is a Rwandan matter, not a French one."" They replied, ""Ladies, we’re sorry, but we have to check to see who the enemy is."" We asked, ""How do you determine who the enemy is just by looking at our identity cards?""** 

**Their response was chilling: ""We know very well that the Tutsis are the enemies.***""*

My wife witnessed a French checkpoint in April 1991: a reinforced roadblock in Ruhengeri with two military vehicles equipped with cannons and manned by the French. **A French soldier pulled a Rwandan man from a vehicle after checking his identity card, handed him over to a Rwandan soldier, who in turn handed him to a group of militiamen who beat him with machetes and spiked clubs—under the eyes of the French. She said there were already bodies in the ditch.** The first time I heard this testimony in 1998, I struggled to believe it. But I saw its consistency and the deep emotional impact on my wife, which remains perceptible 28 years later. 

Moreover, in 2005, we discovered notes from the Élysée \[4\] that reinforced her testimony regarding the strategic importance of this town for the French chief of staff. This testimony also aligns with the findings of the French parliamentary report on Colonel Canovas’s conclusions and his April 1991 proposal for civil defense, which relied precisely on the behavior of militiamen in Ruhengeri:

*""In the Ruhengeri area, he observed the population’s aggressive enthusiasm during security sweeps and road checkpoints. At the same time, he noted the fear and despair of those who had fled their homes, seeking refuge in towns and urban centers. To address the insecurity affecting these displaced people south of Volcanoes National Park, he suggested deploying small undercover units (which would become the infamous Interahamwe) disguised as local farmers in sensitive areas. These units would be tasked with eliminating ''isolated rebels''.''*",2025-02-23 14:13:45
LGBT+ arbitrary detention in Rwanda,"I'm a non-binary person wanting to travel to Rwanda. From my own research, I found that LGBT+ people were arbitrarily detained in transit centers in 2021 -2022 because of how they dressed or expressed themselves and would be cited as violating their public decency or deviant behavior laws. Is this still a common trend that occurs in Rwanda? Are there certain areas to stay away from where this still continues to occur? 

I can't find any recent news articles on this trend and don't know if it's because it has stopped occurring or if censorship of these occurrences has prevented the media from publicizing it. If anyone has any first-hand knowledge of the conditions for LGBT+ people in Rwanda or are able to find any relevant news articles to help me prepare for my trip that would be greatly appreciated. If there has been a change in laws to provide more protections for LGBT+ people in Rwanda since 2021, I would also greatly appreciate to receive information on that as well. Thank you in advance!

Would refining our minerals be more profitable than to export them raw?,"I think we should. Raw minerals like tantalum, tungsten, and gold fetch lower prices because buyers must refine them before use. Processed minerals (e.g., refined tantalum for electronics, smelted gold) sell for a much higher price per ton. A refining industry would create **thousands of jobs** in mining, metallurgy, logistics, and trade. It would also develop related industries, like machinery maintenance, engineering, and chemical processing. It's definitely worth a thought and could probably help us pay off our outstanding debt to the IMF",2025-02-19 17:07:57

Seeking Advice: Safety of Gorilla & Chimp Trek in Rwanda/Uganda (March 2025),"Hi all,

I have a Gorilla, Golden Monkey, and Chimp trek planned for early March 2025 with a reputable trekking company. I’m a 35-year-old solo female traveler with extensive experience traveling alone.

Given the recent news about the DRC conflict and M23 rebel activity, I’m growing increasingly concerned and considering canceling my trek.

I’d appreciate any insights from those familiar with the region. I’m struggling to determine if my itinerary falls near areas of concern and whether this trip is generally considered safe. When I booked, Uganda was listed as a Level 2 travel advisory but has since increased to Level 3 per US (though many countries are at that level).

Here’s my itinerary:

* **Arrival:** Picked up from Kigali Airport, drive to Musanze (overnight).
* **Day 1:** Golden Monkey trek in Volcanoes NP (Rwanda), then cross the border to Bwindi Impenetrable Forest (Uganda).
* **Day 2:** Gorilla trekking in Bwindi → Transfer to Lake Bunyonyi (boat ride, overnight stay).
* **Day 3:** Drive to Kibale National Park (via Fort Portal), visit Bigodi Swamp.
* **Day 4:** Chimp trekking in Kibale → Transfer to Entebbe (overnight near the airport).
* **Departure:** Evening flight from Entebbe (staying in hotel all day).

Rwanda suspends development cooperation with Belgium,"
I think the Rwandan government is right. 

Of course this is regrettable but it shows why „foreign“ is problematic. 
If you really believe what you advertise in aid brochures like „feeding children“, „empowering women“ … how can you justify threatening to cut this aid for political reasons. 

It is rarely about „feeding children „ : it is about creating dependency and control. 


From the press release 

Rwanda will neither be intimidated nor blackmailed at the expense of its national security. Our sole objective is to ensure a secure border and to put a definitive end to violent ethnic extremism policies in our region. Rwanda needs peace and a lasting solution, and no one should continue to tolerate these cycles of conflict that keep repeating due to the inability of the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the international community, decade after decade, to fulfill their commitments to dismantle the UN-sanctioned genocidal FDLR militia and protect the rights of minorities.

The public hearing for this case is scheduled for today, February 12, 2025. Which has already began.

The DRC's legal action centers on accusations that Rwanda has provided support to the M23 rebel group, which has been implicated in numerous atrocities against civilians in the conflict-ridden North Kivu region. The DRC is seeking reparations for the victims, the withdrawal of Rwandan troops, and an end to Rwanda's alleged support for M23. 

This case marks a significant development, as it is the first time an African Union member state has formally sued another at the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. The outcome of this trial could have profound implications for regional stability and the enforcement of human rights within the African Union framework.

President Kagame's words in the joint EAC-SADC summit in Tanzania

“DRC cannot just tell us to keep quiet when they are mounting a security problem against our country. Nobody can tell us to shut up.

We have been begging DRC and its leaders for a long time, we have shared our issues and asked DRC to address them, and they have refused.

Let us not just have another meeting like the many we have had.

We can’t go on forever massaging problems. What is happening there is an ethnic war that has been brewing for a long time, denying people’s rights and then attacking Rwanda. 

You must recognize people’s rights and take a step and resolve the issue.

This war was started by DRC and not anything from Rwanda. It was just brought and put on our shoulders and we were told to own it. We can’t own it. There is no question about it.

Let us use this meeting in a manner that will put into account all these matters seriously, and find a lasting solution.”",2025-02-08 22:09:07

Days before, it was announced that [the superstar and Saudi club Al-Hilal had mutually agreed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/sport/neymar-al-hilal-terminate-contract-spt-intl/index.html) to part ways, 18 months after the forward joined in a high-profile move for a reported €90 million ($98.5M).

And on Wednesday, Neymar stepped back onto the field at the Urbano Caldeira stadium when he came off the bench at the start of the second half against Botafogo in the Brazilian Paulista Championship.

His arrival was accompanied by loud cheers from the Santos faithful. Before the match started, Neymar received a spectacular light show as he emerged from the tunnel.

Santos led 1-0 when the former Barça man – who also celebrated his 33rd birthday on Wednesday – took to the field, but Botafogo equalized through a Alexandre de Jesus header from a corner in the 67th minute.

Botafogo was reduced to 10 men shortly afterwards when Wallison was shown a red card for a foul on Neymar, but despite having the numerical advantage, Santos was unable to retake the lead.""

\----  
Neymar yavuze ko yatangaye nyuma yo gukina bwa mbere kuri Santos kuva agarutse muri iyi kipe y'u Brezili aho yatangiriye umwuga we ukomeye.

Neymar yemeje mu kwezi kwa Mutarama ko yari agarutse muri kipe ye yo mu bwana, imyaka 12 nyuma yo kuyivamo bwa mbere ajya kuri Barcelona nk'umwe mu bakinnyi bakiri bato bizewe cyane baturutse mu Brezili. Mbere y'iminsi mike, byari byatangajwe ko uyu mukinnyi ukomeye n'ikipe ya Al-Hilal yo muri Arabiya Sawudite bemeranijwe gutandukana, amezi 18 nyuma y'uko uyu mukinnyi w'imbere yinjiye muri iyi kipe mu buryo bwamamaye ku mafaranga avugwa ko ari miliyoni 90 z'amayuro (miliyoni 98.5 z'amadolari).

Ku wa gatatu, Neymar yasubiye ku kibuga cya Urbano Caldeira ubwo yinjiraga mu kibuga mu ntangiriro y'igice cya kabiri mu mukino wabaga hagati ya Santos na Botafogo mu gikombe cya Paulista cy'u Brezili.

Kuza kwe kwakiriwe n'amashyi menshi y'abafana ba Santos. Mbere y'uko umukino utangira, Neymar yakiriye isezerano ry'amatara ridasanzwe ubwo yavaga mu mwobo.

Santos yari iyoboye 1-0 ubwo uyu wari umukinnyi wa Barça - wari unizihiza isabukuru y'imyaka 33 ku wa gatatu - yinjiraga mu kibuga, ariko Botafogo irangiza igitego kimwe binyuze kuri Alexandre de Jesus winjije umutwe mu mupira wavuye ku nkokora mu minota ya 67.

Botafogo yagabanutse abakinnyi 10 nyuma gato ubwo Wallison yerekanwaga ikarita itukura kubera gutera Neymar, ariko nubwo bari bafite umubare uruta uw'abandi, Santos ntiyashoboye kongera kuyobora.

1. **Junior-level SWE salaries** (Entry-level)
2. **Mid-level SWE salaries** (2-5 years of experience)
3. **Senior-level SWE salaries** (5+ years of experience)

How much can a software engineer typically expect to earn in Kigali in these categories? Does working for a multinational company offer significantly higher pay compared to local firms?

Burundian president warns about Kagame causing war in the Great Lakes region,"Burundian president is warning people about the destabilization tactics of Kagame and his using young Rwandans to wage a war in DRC.
He asks why does the international community say nothing about it?

He added that he is ready to go to war against Kagame if Kagame ever tries to come for Burundi the way he came for DRC. He warns that Rwanda's war against DRC could spread throughout the region.

https://www.facebook.com/share/v/15ENLCJFFp/

The fact is, Kagame has NO friend in the Great Lakes region, as all his neighbour countries have had problems with him at some point since he came to power. DRC, Tanzania, Kenya, Burundi, Uganda and now even South Africa.

Kagame goes on Twitter and blames everyone but himself, but if all your neighbours, or all your classmates, or all your work colleagues complain about *you* causing trouble to them, maybe *you* are the problem and not them?

Finding rentals made easy.,"**Greetings!**

Finding rentals in Rwanda is challenging, so we took the initiative to build a solution called **Kodesha** ([kodesha.rw](https://kodesha.rw))—a mobile app that simplifies the entire house-hunting process.

We have released **version 1.0.0** on the Play Store: [Kodesha on Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodesha.droid)

**Current Features:**

\- *Price and location filtering*

\- *Posting a ""request""* with a description of the house you’re looking for

\- *Easily starting a conversation* with a broker once you're interested

\- *Listing a house for rent*

**What We're Working On:**

\- *A review and rating system* for brokers

There is a lack of transparency in the rental market, and some brokers take advantage of it. This issue worsens if they realize you are a foreigner or don’t speak Kinyarwanda.

As someone who has rented in Kigali for \*\*eight years\*\*, first as a student and now after, I’ve encountered brokers I would never want to deal with again. With a review system in place, brokers would have to think twice before jeopardizing their reputation and future business.

Since renting in Rwanda is a topic that comes up frequently, I'd love to hear your suggestions! What features do you think would make the rental process easier for you?",2025-02-01 10:51:31
Women on tinder in Kigali,"So I've been in Kigali for a few weeks visiting from England. I have tinder app on my phone and have been using it.

But when I speak to alot of these girls, they seem eager to meet and even have sex but then often times the question of money comes up?! Alot of these girls are expecting to be paid for showing up to a date and possibly doing more.

I just wondered if that's how it goes around here? In the UK, we meet if we like the other person. There's rarely ever a question of money.

East Congo Conflict - media bias?,"Many news outlets covering the conflict in eastern Congo overlook two crucial aspects: 
(1) the presence of the genocidal FDLR militia and 
(2) the marginalization of Rwandese Speaking Congolese citizens. 
The FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) is composed of remnants from the genocidal regime that operated in Rwanda prior to 1994. For nearly three decades, they have been active in eastern Congo, with the stated goal of attacking Rwanda and restoring the pre-1994 government. In recent developments, the FDLR has openly cooperated with the Congolese army and received public support from the Congolese government.
(On 2)
A significant portion of the population in eastern Congo speaks Kinyarwanda. They have inhabited this region for centuries -  which was part of the Rwandan Kingdom. The region was placed within during the colonial partition of Africa. These Kinyarwanda-speaking Congolese have long been marginalized and labeled as “Rwandans,” often forced to flee. Since 1994, they have been targeted by the FDLR and other militias seeking to drive them out of their ancestral lands to Rwanda. The Congolese government has repeatedly failed to protect them as citizens, and in some instances, has viewed them with suspicion rather than recognizing their legitimate status as Congolese.
This may helps understand the position of the East African Community which asks the Congolose government to address those two issues : to dismantle the FDLR militia and to enter in dialogue with M23 to address the second issue.

Looking to visit Rwanda for a gorilla trek - solo woman ,"I'd love recommendations for a reputable company, especially as a woman travelling alone. From what I've read so far, I do see that there are also treks in Uganda that are less expensive, but the experience seems to be better in Rwanda (likelihood of seeing them up close). Not saying this is 100% the case, but this is what I've heard/read so far. Please let me know if I am wrong! I'm primarly interested in seeing gorillas, but if there is a package where you can see gorillas one day and chimpanzees the next, that would be amazing. I've read of people also doing a safari which I wouldn't mind depending on the cost, but it's not a must since I've done that in Tanzania. 

  
I would like to stay somewhere decently nice, but the lodges that have been recommended in other posts are like $2000+ USD/night, any recommendations that are closer to like $150-300 USD/night. Open to a lodge or glamping. This is a once in a lifetime trip that I know will be expensive, but I'm not a millionare, unfornately. I am looking to go early/mid September if that makes a difference.",2025-01-15 03:27:12

Are white people in Rwanda given more preferential treatment?,"This might not just be an issue concentrated in Rwanda, this could be a continental issue even  Asian countries deal with this too. However what I have noticed in Rwanda while visiting, is that white people do sometimes get treated better, even given extra help than other black people or Rwandese people. 

I know that Rwanda is trying to encouraged  more tourists to visit Rwanda, so the impression tourists get of the country and it’s people is important but that shouldn’t mean putting white people on a pedestal either in my opinion. 

 I guess it’s just disappointing to see. I’m Rwandese btw but grew up in the west, so I was always around white people, so I am used to being treated differently because of my race but I don’t expect any less from people there. However while I’m in Rwanda I thought the last thing I had to think about was being treated differently because of my race as well. Also because there are fewer white people there, it somehow makes it more noticeable when they are given preferential treatment compared to everyone else. 

Again this is more of an issue in the whole of Africa but I truly hope someday even Rwanda learns to stop treating tourists, foreigners and white people better than their own people. ",2025-01-14 12:01:19

This just made my day. It's not often an African Country takes a stand and says, no - you're not treating my people like trash. ""Investor"" is not getting away with it - he won't buy off the authorities. If we're to make Africa a nice place to live in - we need to have some pride. Not be compromised by money. Normally - the culprit gives a bribe to the authorities and victim and it is forgotten, or they're deported (like the Chinaman who called the president a monkey in Kenya) but not in this case.

ape trekking in Rwanda questinos,"Hello, i will be for work in Kigali, Rwanda in March and will have 4-5 days extra afterwards im planning on taking to explore.

From my research 1 day for gorilla trekking is an option (in volcano NP), chimps require 2 days minimum (in Nyungwe park) and safari is whenever in Akagara (no requirements). If i do 2 days chips -> going to volcano NP via lake Kivu for 1 day with gorillas and then one day i akagara (via Kigali) - is anything wrong with that itinirary? ",2025-01-12 19:25:33

 Looking for Info on Master’s in Architecture and Veterinary Medicine Studies in Rwanda,"Hi everyone!

I’m hoping to get some guidance about studying in Rwanda for two friends planning their next education steps. Here’s the situation:

**1.   Master’s in Architecture**

* One of my friends finished their bachelor’s degree in architecture in **Burundi** and now wants to pursue a **master’s degree in architecture** in Rwanda.
* Are there any universities in Rwanda that offer this program?
* What’s the application process like, and what are the admission requirements?
* Do these programs include internships or connections with architecture firms?

**2. Veterinary Medicine Studies**

* Another friend of mine completed high school in the **DRC** and is interested in studying veterinary medicine in Rwanda.
* I’ve heard there might be a **short-term training program (around 18 months)** in veterinary medicine, but I’m not sure if this is true. Can anyone confirm?
* If that program doesn’t exist, are there any universities in Rwanda offering a **bachelor’s degree in veterinary medicine**?
* What are the admission requirements, and how long would the program take?
* Does the curriculum cover both small and large animals, or is it more specialized?

If you’ve studied in Rwanda or know anyone who has been through these programs, I’d love to hear your advice or experiences. Any tips, links, or details would be super helpful!
