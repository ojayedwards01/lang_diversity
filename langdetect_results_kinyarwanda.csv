"Hello everybody

So I am 27yo and from Scotland in the UK. I want to do a masters degree at a university in Africa and I heard that Kigali is the safest city in Africa. 

So I have decided to book a holiday to Kigali later this year... for a month, just to see what it is like living there. I think that is a bit much too much time... is the cost of living cheap in Kigali? Because I dont think I have put enough thought into booking this holiday... but I have just booked it. I can't change it now. 

I've read on this forum that there isn't anything to do in Kigali, is that correct? And that people speak Kinyarwandan and not English? I dont think I can learn an entire language in a few months...

What is Kigali like? Are people nice to foreigners? Is it true there is no crime? I am not worried, I just don't want to be hassled all the time. 

Does nobody speak English? I heard English was the official language, and Rwanda is part of the British Commonwealth, so I thought it would be fine. 

Should I just go to Kampala now instead, and just spend a week in Kigali or something?

I really wanted Kigali to be the one I liked, but I heard Kampalans speak more English.

I'm part of a small team building **AfriX** — a digital wallet that helps Africans send and receive **local currency** across borders instantly (like from Nigeria to Ghana) using **blockchain-backed stablecoins** and **mobile money integrations**.

Instead of routing through USD or banks abroad, AfriX lets you:

✅ Send/receive **Naira, Cedis, Shillings** directly  
✅ Use **MoMo wallets** (MTN, Airtel, M-PESA, etc.) to cash in/out  
✅ Pay merchants or people instantly across Africa  
✅ Skip FX stress with local currency-backed stablecoins

We’re starting in **Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Egypt**, and launching a **closed beta in a few months**.

🔎 **Question for you:**  
How do *you* currently send/receive money across African countries?  
What’s your biggest frustration? Would you trust a wallet like this?

I am a researcher currently in Rwanda working on a project about the evolution of agricultural and livestock systems in the Musanze district, in the North of the country.

• Whether there are differences between sectors or areas within the district (for example, some areas more focused on farming, others more on livestock),  
• What types of farmers make up this territory.

🗣️ I am especially looking for elderly people living in Musanze who are willing to share (unpaid) their memories and experiences on these topics. I am also interested in geographers or anyone who can provide useful information.

"Spent 7 days in Rwanda as a solo female traveler and had an amazing time! After reflecting on my observations, I have the following questions for locals

**Things I Smelled**

1. I was surprised by the smoke smell in Kigali and Musanze in the middle of July. Is the smoke smell less strong in the winter time? Which months does it get better? 

2. Body odor: deodorant seems to be sold in grocery stores but from walking past people on the street, it doesn't seem to be widely used. I wonder, do locals also notice the smell of body odor? What is the general perception of body odor and perfumes/cologne? Coming from the US, I have experienced the opposite where people like to heavily spray perfumes/cologne to the point where the perfume smell can be overwhelming.  

**Things I Saw**

1. In Kimihurura Roundabout Park late at night, are there foxes or fox like animals? I saw a four legged animal from the back but the tail seemed too bushy to be a dog or cat?

2. From walking in Kigali, I saw a lot of young kids/toddlers with parents but never saw kids throwing tantrums/cry/complain. This is a stark contrast to what I observe in NYC where on the subway, often times kids will throw tantrums/whine to parents. How do parents teach young kids to be so well behaved?

3. This relates to question 2 but how is everyone raised to be so calm? Is this specific to Rwanda or does this calmness trait apply to people of neighboring countries as well? Are people secretly anxious or worried about things but just do a great job of masking it in the facial expressions? I don't think I ever saw any moto taxi driver get angry or raise their voice even when cars are cutting them off. This level of calmness was the biggest culture shock to witness coming from NYC where I see different personalities and a lot of people expressing their emotions. In Rwanda, I found myself speaking more softly and quietly to mirror the cultural norm. 

**Other Questions**

1. For Rwandans who have traveled outside the country, what was the biggest surprise to you and where did you visit? 

2. I personally did not bargain with moto drivers, do locals in Kigali bargain with moto drivers on the price of their ride?",en,1.0

"If poor 3rd-worlders from Rwanda are gifted smartphones for the very first time, how could they use Grok 3 to improve and enrich their lives?

===

Grok 3 replied:

If people in Rwanda, particularly those in impoverished communities, receive smartphones for the first time, Grok 3—xAI’s advanced AI chatbot—could be a powerful tool to improve and enrich their lives in practical and transformative ways. By leveraging its accessibility through mobile apps (iOS and Android) and its features like Think Mode, DeepSearch, and real-time information retrieval, Rwandans could address challenges and seize opportunities in education, agriculture, entrepreneurship, healthcare, and community development. Below are specific ways they could use Grok 3, tailored to the context of a low-income, resource-constrained environment:

### 1. **Education and Skill Development**
- **Access to Knowledge and Learning Resources**: Grok 3 can provide instant answers to questions on a wide range of topics, from basic literacy and numeracy to advanced subjects like science and coding. For example, a young Rwandan could ask, “How do I improve my reading skills?” or “What is algebra?” and receive clear, step-by-step explanations. Its ability to process complex queries and generate human-like text makes it a virtual tutor for self-paced learning.[](
- **Language Learning**: Many Rwandans speak Kinyarwanda, but learning English or French could open job opportunities. Grok 3 can assist with language practice, offering conversational exercises, grammar tips, or translations. For instance, a user could say, “Teach me basic English phrases for business,” and Grok 3 could provide tailored lessons.
- **Skill-Building for Jobs**: Grok 3’s coding capabilities (demonstrated by its 79.4% score on LiveCodeBench) could help aspiring tech workers learn programming basics, like Python, even with limited internet. Users could ask, “How do I write a simple program?” and receive functional code examples.[](

### 2. **Agriculture and Livelihood Improvement**
- **Farming Advice**: Agriculture is a backbone of Rwanda’s economy, with many relying on subsistence farming. Grok 3 can provide practical advice on crop management, pest control, or soil fertility. For example, a farmer could ask, “How do I protect my maize from pests without chemicals?” and Grok 3 could suggest affordable, organic methods based on its knowledge base.
- **Market Information**: Using DeepSearch, Grok 3 can pull real-time data (if internet is available) on crop prices or market trends, helping farmers decide what to grow or when to sell. A query like “What’s the price of beans in Kigali markets?” could inform better trading decisions.[](
- **Climate Adaptation**: Grok 3 can offer insights on weather patterns or climate-resilient farming techniques. A user could ask, “How do I farm during a drought?” and receive tips like water-saving irrigation methods suited to Rwanda’s conditions.

### 3. **Entrepreneurship and Economic Opportunities**
- **Business Ideas and Planning**: Grok 3 can help aspiring entrepreneurs brainstorm low-cost business ideas. For example, a user could ask, “What small business can I start with 10,000 RWF?” and Grok 3 might suggest ideas like selling second-hand clothes or starting a small vegetable stand, with steps to get started.
- **Financial Literacy**: Grok 3 can explain basic financial concepts, like budgeting or saving, in simple terms. A query like “How do I save money on a small income?” could yield practical advice, such as tracking expenses or joining local savings groups (common in Rwanda).
- **Access to Digital Platforms**: Smartphones enable access to mobile money platforms like MTN Mobile Money, widely used in Rwanda. Grok 3 could guide users on setting up accounts or using digital payments securely, asking, “How do I use mobile money to pay for goods?”[](

### 4. **Healthcare and Well-Being**
- **Health Information**: Grok 3 can provide basic health advice, like “What are the symptoms of malaria?” or “How do I treat a fever at home?” This is critical in areas with limited healthcare access. While not a substitute for doctors, it can help users make informed decisions or know when to seek professional care.
- **Nutrition Guidance**: Malnutrition is a challenge in some Rwandan communities. Grok 3 could suggest affordable, nutritious meals using local ingredients, answering queries like “What’s a healthy meal I can make with beans and bananas?”
- **Mental Health Support**: Grok 3’s conversational abilities, including its upcoming Voice Mode, could offer basic emotional support or stress management tips. A user might say, “I feel stressed about money,” and Grok 3 could suggest coping strategies or mindfulness exercises.[](

### 5. **Community Development and Connectivity**
- **Access to Information**: Smartphones connect remote communities to information. Grok 3 can answer community-focused questions, like “How do we start a cooperative for farmers?” or “What are government programs for youth in Rwanda?” This empowers groups to organize and access resources.
- **Cultural Preservation**: Grok 3 could help document local knowledge or traditions. A user could ask, “How do I record a Kinyarwanda folktale?” and receive guidance on using the smartphone to create audio or text records, preserving cultural heritage.
- **Networking**: Grok 3 can suggest ways to use platforms like X (accessible via the smartphone) to connect with others, such as finding mentors or joining online communities for Rwandan entrepreneurs.

### 6. **Practical Considerations and Accessibility**
- **Ease of Use**: Grok 3 is available for free on the X platform, iOS, and Android apps, with limited quotas for non-subscribers. Its mobile apps are user-friendly, and Voice Mode (available on iOS/Android) allows illiterate users to interact via speech, critical in a country where literacy rates are improving but not universal.[](
- **Low-Resource Compatibility**: Grok 3 mini, designed for low-compute scenarios, could work better on basic smartphones or with limited internet, making it suitable for rural Rwanda.[](
- **Language Support**: While Grok 3 primarily operates in English, its conversational nature could adapt to simple English queries or, with future updates, potentially support Kinyarwanda, making it more accessible.

### Challenges and Recommendations
- **Internet Access**: Rwanda has made strides in mobile connectivity (over 70% mobile penetration), but rural areas may lack consistent internet. Users could rely on Grok 3’s offline capabilities (if available) or use it during visits to areas with connectivity, like community centers.[](
- **Digital Literacy**: First-time smartphone users may need basic training. Grok 3 could assist by answering, “How do I use my smartphone?” with step-by-step guidance.
- **Cultural Relevance**: Users should frame questions specifically (e.g., “What crops grow best in Rwanda’s volcanic soil?”) to get tailored responses, as Grok 3’s general knowledge may not always account for local context.
- **Ethical Use**: Given past controversies (e.g., Grok 3’s unprompted political responses), users should verify sensitive information with local sources, like agricultural extension officers or health workers.[](

### Getting Started
To use Grok 3, Rwandans would need to:
1. Download the Grok app from the iOS App Store or Android Play Store (or use X if pre-installed).
2. Sign in with an X account (free to create) or use the standalone app.[](
3. Ask questions via text or voice, starting with simple queries like “How do I grow tomatoes?” or “What jobs are available in Kigali?”
4. Use Think Mode for complex problem-solving (e.g., “How do I budget for a small shop?”) or DeepSearch for research (e.g., “What are Rwanda’s export crops?”).[](

### Example Scenario
A Rwandan farmer, Marie, receives a smartphone and learns to use Grok 3. She asks, “How can I increase my potato yield?” Grok 3 suggests crop rotation, affordable fertilizers, and local seed varieties. She then asks, “Where can I sell potatoes in Gisenyi?” and DeepSearch provides market contacts. Later, she uses Voice Mode to learn basic English for negotiating with buyers, improving her income.

By providing actionable knowledge, Grok 3 can empower Rwandans to overcome barriers, build skills, and connect with opportunities, significantly enriching their lives despite resource constraints.[](",en,1.0

"Google Gemini answered this way:

For individuals in Rwanda receiving smartphones for the first time, Google Gemini could be a transformative tool to significantly improve and enrich their lives in numerous ways. Here are some key areas:
1. Education and Information Access:
 * Personalized Learning: Gemini can act as a personal tutor, explaining complex concepts in various subjects, from basic literacy and numeracy to more advanced topics. It can provide practice quizzes and adapt to individual learning paces and styles.
 * Language Translation: For a country with multiple languages, Gemini's translation capabilities can help bridge communication gaps, allowing access to information and learning materials in their local languages, or helping them learn new languages for broader opportunities.
 * Access to Information: Users can ask Gemini about anything – health, agriculture, local news, history, or global events. It can summarize complex articles, explain unfamiliar terms, and provide information in an easily understandable format, bridging the information gap often present in remote or underserved areas.
 * Digital Literacy: Gemini can help users navigate their new smartphones and other digital tools, teaching them about online safety, how to use various apps, and general digital literacy skills.
2. Health and Well-being:
 * Health Information: Users can inquire about common illnesses, symptoms, preventative measures, and basic first aid. While Gemini should not replace professional medical advice, it can provide immediate, accessible information that can be crucial in areas with limited healthcare access.
 * Hygiene and Sanitation: Gemini can offer advice on best practices for hygiene, safe drinking water, and sanitation, contributing to public health.
 * Nutrition and Food Security: It can provide information on balanced diets, local food sources, and even offer simple recipes or advice on preserving food.
 * Mental Health Support: While not a therapist, Gemini can offer general advice on stress management, mindfulness, and direct users to appropriate resources if available.
3. Economic Empowerment and Livelihoods:
 * Agricultural Advice: Farmers can use Gemini to get real-time information on weather patterns, crop diseases, pest control, soil health, and best farming practices specific to their region, potentially leading to improved yields and income.
 * Market Information: Gemini could help users understand market prices for their produce or goods, identify potential buyers, and learn about fair trade practices.
 * Skill Development: Individuals can learn new skills relevant to local industries or entrepreneurship, such as basic business management, financial literacy, crafting techniques, or even digital skills for remote work.
 * Entrepreneurship Support: Gemini can assist aspiring entrepreneurs with brainstorming business ideas, creating simple business plans, understanding small business loans (if available), and marketing strategies.
 * Financial Inclusion: Gemini can explain concepts related to mobile banking, digital payments, and savings, helping to increase financial literacy and access to financial services.
4. Community Development and Engagement:
 * Civic Engagement: Gemini can provide information about local governance, civic rights, and community initiatives, fostering more informed and engaged citizens.
 * Cultural Preservation: Users can leverage Gemini to document and share their local history, traditions, and stories, contributing to cultural preservation.
 * Emergency Information: In times of natural disasters or other emergencies, Gemini could provide critical, up-to-date information and safety guidelines.
Challenges and Considerations:
While the potential is immense, it's important to consider challenges:
 * Connectivity: Access to reliable internet is crucial for Gemini to function effectively.
 * Literacy Levels: While Gemini can aid literacy, some users may initially struggle with text-based interfaces. Voice input and output will be vital.
 * Digital Divide: Ensuring equitable access to smartphones and connectivity across all demographics.
 * Responsible AI Use: Addressing potential biases in AI, ensuring information is accurate and culturally relevant, and protecting user privacy.
 * Local Content and Context: The effectiveness of Gemini will be enhanced if it's trained on and can provide information relevant to the specific Rwandan context, including local languages, customs, and agricultural practices.
By thoughtfully deploying and supporting access to tools like Google Gemini, there's a significant opportunity to empower individuals in Rwanda and contribute to broader socio-economic development.",en,1.0

"Hi r/Rwanda,

I'm an Austrian writer/journalist writing about cultural healing practices worldwide. Rwanda is part of my 24-country book project journey to understand how different cultures process emotional pain and support each other.

Similarly to posts I made on other countries subreddits, I'm interested in learning about Gacaca reconciliation processes, Ubuntu healing principles, community healing practices, and how Rwandan culture approaches recovery and emotional wellbeing.

**I'd appreciate guidance on:**

* Cultural etiquette when requesting interviews with Rwandans?
* How to respectfully discuss healing and reconciliation topics?
* Appropriate behavior and respectful gestures?
* How to approach discussions of recovery and healing sensitively?
* Best places to meet people open to cultural conversations?
* Any specific protocols for discussing community healing?
* How to show proper respect for Rwandan resilience and values?

As a European, I want to ensure I approach this book project with maximum cultural sensitivity.

"I'm sharing here my personal experience as a single Westerner who lived in **Kigali** for several years, with a clear and detailed overview of the **cost of living**. My only goal is to help you get a realistic picture, based on my own experience, with full transparency and without any pretension.

**1. Fixed monthly expenses (on average):**

* **Housing (private and full furnished house)**: €600 → Includes rent, electricity (without AC), wifi, guard, and maintenance -  prices vary depending on the client and also on the landlord... but roughly, the places I considered good were around €500-600 all-inclusive. However, lately, I have the feeling that prices have gone up to around €800–900.
* **Mobile internet & call**: €10
* **Groceries**: €100 → (Supermarkets like Simba, T2000, local markets for fruits, vegetables, and meat)
* **Transport**: €70 moto taxi
* **Other (subscriptions, miscellaneous plans)**: €20

**Total fixed expenses**: **€800 / month**

**2. Monthly leisure/personal expenses (on average):**

* **Vacations / Weekends**: €250 (averaged over the year)
* **Restaurants / Outings**: €100
* **Other leisure & personal purchases**: €150

**Total leisure expenses**: **€500 / month**

**Summary:** For my profile and lifestyle, I spent around **€1,300 per month**, including **€800 in fixed costs** and **€500 in leisure/personal expenses**.

If you need to manage your own transportation: private car : around €600/month rental or around €10,000 for decent purchase → + €150/month for fuel (excluding frequent repairs on older cars). Owning a car can be a major expense (most are old, break down often, and require costly maintenance).

**Comparison with local cost of living:**

* A **Rwandan daily worker** earning about **€70/month** typically rents a **single room with no kitchen for €18/month**
* A **skilled Rwandan** with an average salary of **€300–500/month** usually pays around **€150-200/month** for a basic room + kitchen.
* Someone earning between €1,500 and €3,000/month would typically rent a place in the €500 to €1,500, which corresponds to a very good standard of housing, more or less equivalent to Western standards.
* **Wealthy Rwandan** or **expats working for multinational companies**, earning over **€4,000/month**, often get very big housing provided, worth between **€1,500 and €5,000/month**, with many extra benefits included

Kigali offers a **wide range of lifestyles**. For a **single Westerner**, including leisure, transportation, and a few weekend trips, I recommend planning for **minimum around €900-1,300/month** **for single Westerner.**  
Of course, if you’re sharing accommodation, my estimate will be lowered by at least €300.

**Housing is relatively expensive** in Kigali, as well as cars, luxury tourism, and Western-style products.  
If you want to keep your budget low, you really need to **change your habits,** start by buying **local fruits and vegetables at the market**, and **avoid processed foods** similar to what you'd find in Western countries.  
Schooling for children also has a cost, as do subscriptions to various gyms or other activities.

"It's now 7 PM I'm in the middle of Nyungwe, and I have done no activities in the park, not even a small hike. I have been here for 8 hours doing nothing. TL;DR at the bottom.

We booked a Nyungwe trip with Milimount Tours and paid in full on Monday. They told us to catch a 4 AM bus from Kigali today (Saturday), which we did. After a 6-hour ride, we arrived at Nyungwe National Park around 10 AM.

To our surprise, there were hundreds of people waiting for the zipline, but only 24 harnesses were available. After each group finishes the ride, porters have to hike ~5km round trip to bring the harnesses back. This causes a 2+ hour delay between groups. On top of that, if it rains, the zipline shuts down.

With this setup, only 3–4 small groups (under 100 people total) can ride the zipline per day.

We were supposed to do 3 zipline rides, a canopy walk, and a tea plantation visit — but we ended up doing none of it. After sitting in Nyungwe for 8 hours, the tour company gave us two bad options:

1. Do one zipline ride (not guaranteed) and get no refund.

2. Do nothing and get a refund.

Poor planning and communication from both Milimount Tours and Nyungwe Park made this an incredibly frustrating waste of a day.

**If you’ve got a bigger platform on Twitter or Instagram, feel free to repost — we just want the message to reach the right people.**

Update: We got a 20k refund which is not even half of what we paid for the trip, 65k

*TL;DR:*
Paid for full Nyungwe tour package with 3 zipline rides, canopy walk, and tea plantation. After a 6-hour trip, I waited 8 hours and did nothing due to massive overbooking, slow zipline logistics, and poor communication. The tour company offered either a 1 zipline ride (no refund) or a full refund (no activities). The whole day was wasted.",en,1.0

Got the bags with some attitude from the lost baggage department but I was unfazed then customs also wanted to check the bags but I left the keys behind … I gave her permission and she broke into each bag in less than 30 seconds with just a pen (I think I get why people wrap their bags now)

I’m African and finally gearing up for that long-awaited trip to Portugal (or anywhere in Schengen, really). I’d love to hand off the visa legwork to a reliable agency,someone who answers emails promptly, is transparent about fees, and actually knows what they’re doing.

A few things I’m hoping for:

	•	Real track record: Agencies you’ve used that got your Schengen visa without drama.

	•	Solid support: Help with paperwork, booking appointments, follow-ups everything.

	•	Fair pricing: No surprise charges halfway through.

	•	Red flags: Any warning signs I should watch out for?

If you’ve had a smooth experience (or a horror story I can learn from!), please share or DM. Your insights could save me a lot of time and stress. 
Thanks so much!",en,1.0
"Hey everyone,

I’m an African (DRC) planning to visit Portugal, but I’m open to applying through any Schengen country since once I have the visa, I can hop around freely.

What I’m looking for:
	1.Top country pick for easiest approval Portugal preferred, but which embassy/consulate has the smoothest process?
	2.Appointment tips, best time slots, booking tricks, ideal lead time.
	3.Extra docs like invitation letters, cover letters, templates, or anything that gave you an edge.
	4.Personal wins,anyone from Africa who nailed it? What did you do differently?

I’d really appreciate short, practical pointers or your own success story.",en,1.0

I'm looking to rent a 3-bedroom furnished house or apartment in Kibagabaga, Remera, Gismenti,or Kimironko (or nearby). My preference is to deal directly with the owner to avoid high broker fees — but I’m open to a reliable agency or broker you'd recommend if their commission is reasonable who charges a fair fee?

Also Is there any site, Facebook group, or local platform where owners list directly?

Hello - we are traveling SFO to Kigali mid May 2026.

Kagame has again disappeared from life for 15 days straight. The #1 worrying sign is that the government has arrested a second time the only opposition leader left inside the country because they are worried she might be handed over power.  Social media is full of rumours of insider fighting within his own party. This also comes at a time when Rwanda is increasingly isolated internationally due its support of M23. With or without him the US brokered peace deal in the DRC is getting signed on 27th of June. Now they’ve announced a 6 days holiday in the first week of July!!! What is going on?? I’m sure many of his apologists in this sub have also started questioning whether Kagame is alive,en,1.0

"Hey guys! Me and my fiancé got our first house in Rwanda, it’s a 4 bedroom and we’re excited. We’re in the process of furnishing it and we just had some questions…

1. Where’s the best place to buy a bed & sofa? Are there any websites? A few people mentioned some shops downtown but I prefer to browse on the website and if I like the look of something id go into store

2. Portable Air conditioning? We don’t want to install an AC unit just yet so we wanted a portable one for the time being, where can we find one and any rough estimate on how much one would be? We ideally want 2 (1 for living room, 1 for the master bedroom) 

3. Is it worth getting a generator? How often are power outages? Some say it’s often and some say it isn’t, we will be staying in kagarama if that’s useful 

4. We have a helper who is staying there at the moment, he was looking after the house and he’s well known in the area so we decided to keep him as he will be staying in the boys quarters. His role is to clean inside/outside and act as security, he asked for 50k a month and an additional 50k for food - is that too much? Some people said they pay theirs 30k, but I’m unsure. I don’t mind paying 50k but my fiancé says it’s a bit much seeing as he’s just cleaning.

Reasons to give it a try:

1. That money actually goes to the local community instead of hotel conglomerates

2. The most beautiful part of Rwanda are the incredible villages scattered everywhere. Plus, interacting with local Rwandans around the Twin Lakes is amazing! They rarely see foreigners.

3. Way more authentic experience. If taking hotel boats, you might as well be anywhere else in the world.

"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping to get some guidance on a situation I’m dealing with in Rwanda.

My father passed away recently in Rwanda while receiving treatment at a hospital. There was an outstanding hospital bill, and a local law firm offered to help us so we could pay the bill using funds from my father's bank account there.

The lawyers offered to help by contacting the bank and hospital, gathering the necessary documents, and drafting a letter to the bank requesting they release the payment to the hospital. I provided them with documents like my passport, birth certificate, my father's will, and ID for my siblings.

They carried out the task, and the bank paid the hospital directly. Initially the solicitor had a verbal agreement with my late fathers ex-boss/friend (who is local) that he would pick up the bill. However, for some unknown they didn't bill him for this.

Now ive come to Rwanda to sort some things out, it's been 4 months later and they have sent me a letter demanding $3,000+taxes USD in legal fees. This was the first time any fee was mentioned—there was no prior agreement, no engagement letter, and no quote.

I feel taken advantage of, especially as I was grieving, overseas, and unfamiliar with the local legal system. I've asked for a breakdown and plan to dispute the fee. I’ve also contacted a UK solicitor for advice.

To complicate things, I believe one of the lawyers may have held a senior position in the Rwanda Bar Association.

My only other option is to contact the British Embassy as a UK citizen?

Has anyone experienced anything similar, or can offer advice on how to handle this kind of situation?

"I am travelling to Rwanda later this year with my wife, specifically to go Gorilla Trekking. I understand about the permits and how to book: my question relates to transport between Kigali and the National Park. I have researched enough to understand that I can book a day tour where they will pick us up in Kigali early (4:30am), take us the gorilla trekking and return us in the afternoon but I found all these tours to be quite expensive, especially for two of us. Yes, they provide some breakfast and a bottle of water but it seems like it is really just transport. I am considering hiring a car and driving. In that instance I would drive up one day and overnight near the National Park, do the trek the next morning and drive back to Kigali that afternoon. Hire cars seem cheap but I am unsure about the drive. Any advice on my options and how easy it is to drive up to the National Park would be appreciated.",en,1.0

As a foreigner, I’m trying to understand the process, potential challenges, and local expectations. I have a few questions I hope you can help with:

1. Are there areas near Kigali where land is available with access to basic infrastructure (water, electricity, roads)?
2. What are the average land prices per square meter in both central and suburban areas?
3. Is it common for foreigners to face inflated pricing, and how can one ensure they are being charged a fair market rate and not taken advantage off?
4. What are the typical legal and administrative steps to verify land ownership and ensure there are no disputes or encumbrances?

"I often hear from Rwandans that there is no proof that the RDF is in Congo, that the conflict in Congo has nothing to do with Rwanda, and I wanted to know if Rwandan civilians are actually made to ignore UN reports that directly prove the Rwandan army’s presence in DRC. Do Rwandan civilians actually believe their government over independent, third party, UN reports? Do Rwandans really believe that everyone is lying except for their government? 

Every single year since 2004 the United Nations writes reports on the state of the DRC conflict using neutral investigators with no connection to any parties (the 2021 report, for example, was investigated by independent experts from Kenya, France, Colombia, Benin, Belgium, and the UK— nobody from DRC or Rwanda itself), and the most recent reports include the following:

“40. The Group obtained further evidence - authenticated photographs, drone footage, video recordings, testimony and intelligence - confirming systematic border incursions by RDF and its reinforced presence in Petit Nord, with RDF matching, if not surpassing, M23 in numbers (see paras. 37 and 43). RDF positioned itself at the frontlines, operated high-tech weaponry and directly engaged in combat. Its presence was critical in repelling joint FARDC-Wazalendo offensives and occupying new territories in Petit Nord (see annex 27). 

41. In January 2024, at least 1,000 RDF troops entered the Democratic Republic of the Congo through various border crossings east of Kibumba, Rutshuru territory, and were deployed to key military positions. Following this reinforcement, on 3 February, RDF and M23 took control of Shasha, a village with strategic access to Lake Kivu. RDF maintained combat positions on the hills around Sake, which it still occupied at the time of drafting. In early April 2023, RDF took control of three vacated MONUSCO positions north-west of Sake (see annex 28). At the time of drafting, 500 RDF and 500 M23 combatants, the latter commanded by the sanctioned individuals Baudoin Ngaguye (CDi.019) and Bernard Byamungu (CDi.038) and Julien Mahano Baratuje, controlled the areas north, west and south of Sake.”

"Hi everyone,

I'm a software engineer and IoT hobbyist planning to dive into drone development.

This is purely for **learning and educational purposes**, not for any commercial activity like photography, delivery, or surveillance.

* What does the law in **Rwanda** say about drone use for **personal, non-commercial, or educational** purposes?
* Are there any **maximum altitude limits** or **design restrictions**?
* Do I need to **register** my drone or get a **license**, even for **home-made drones** tested in **non-public areas**?
* Are there any **exceptions** or **allowances** for hobbyists, students, or educational drone projects?
* Any insights from people who’ve done similar projects locally?

If anyone has **first-hand experience**, I’d really appreciate your input. I want to make sure I’m compliant with the rules before I begin any serious testing.

"So, many people probably use the Facebook marketplace to buy things or at least explore the prices and other information on things they want or might want to buy.

If you check carefully there are so many duplicate listings with prices being so much different.

By same listings, I mean the same pictures being copied from original listings or probably real.



Say something cost 1M RWF (listed by a legit seller)

A scammer will list the same thing (copy pictures and descriptions) for 500K RWF.



If you see two things with one costing less, it's easy to say the price is a factor, and you are very likely to engage in conversation with the listing with the lower price.



You chat and bring down the prices from 500K to 350k and agree on getting the item.

The scammer likely will ask you for location and when you say in Kigali and ask where they are based, they will say like in Nyamata somewhere (it is an example). But here is the thing they are scammers and claim they do free delivery anywhere in Kigali (that's the catch). 

You are probably left with two options:

1. Chat about how they can deliver

2. Ask them the exact address and come pick them up.

If you go with option 1, they will insist that you pay half the price and pay the rest after deliver.

Ask you may guess, whatever you pay there you are ripped off. They were never real in the first place.

If you choose option 2. They will keep insisting on delivery and if you don't agree they cut the connection or ignore your calls or messages since they have no other means of getting your money.



This is a real observation of someone who regularly buys on the Facebook marketplace.

That is just one way but there are so many ways they do it.



What can you do in those situations?!

Maybe:

\- Always demand to get their exact address so you can check the items.

\- Or ask for payment on delivery. I mean pay 100% only when you receive the items.

Or just buy from known shops, and sellers.



Just be aware there are a lot of scams happening there and be vigilant.



**Disclaimer:** Not all listings are scams and a listing being cheap doesn't mean its a scam. There are many honest and legit sellers on Facebook Marketplace. This post is just a heads-up based on common patterns I've noticed.",en,1.0

"Hey everyone,

I see a lot of travelers asking about car rentals in Kigali, so I thought I'd share some local advice. I'm based here and run a small rental company, so hopefully this helps!

- Driving in Kigali is pretty smooth — roads are in good condition, and people are generally respectful drivers. Just be ready for lots of motorbikes and hidden speed bumps!

- Insurance is really important. Even if you’re a careful driver, unexpected things can happen, so make sure you’re fully covered.

- Self-drive or driver? If you’re new to Africa, sometimes having a local driver (even just for the first day) makes things way easier. After that, self-driving is fine!

I started Platinumwheels Rentals to make it easier (and cheaper) for travelers to get around. We have small cars and SUVs, available for self-drive or with a driver, plus 24/7 support if anything comes up.

If you have any questions about driving here, the best road trips outside Kigali, or renting tips in general, feel free to ask! Happy to share what I know.

Where’s the real economic independence? We're building convention centers and smart cities, but most rural areas still lack proper access to healthcare, quality education, or electricity. The leadership boasts about being ""self-reliant,"" but how self-reliant can we be when a cut in donor funding could crash entire programs?

I get that aid helped us recover post-genocide, but are we using it as a crutch now? Why aren't we investing more in agriculture, small industries, and local innovation instead of relying on foreign-funded NGOs to do basic development work?

"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.


The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.

What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)

I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.",en,1.0

"# Moses Turahirwa: The Story of the Most Ungrateful Rwandan of His Time



# There’s hardly a need to explain who Moses Turahirwa is—or to introduce his brand, Moshions. Many of us have worn it, or at least admired it. Personally, I only own one shirt from the label. But let’s be honest—Moshions wasn’t just a fashion brand; it became a cultural symbol. It took off in a way few Rwandan brands ever have, gracing the wardrobes of none other than the President of Rwanda, the First Lady, and even the First Daughter. That level of endorsement alone elevated Moshions far beyond what any runway or press release could do.



# It was a perfect blend: Moses’ undeniable talent and Rwanda’s soft power. Together, they propelled him to global heights—heights he could never have reached on his own.



# Then came the scandal.



# Moses was arrested and held for 76 days after publicly displaying a fake Rwandan passport, claiming a new identity as a woman—allegedly with the blessing of His Excellency, President Paul Kagame. At the time of his arrest, he had over $2 million in legally-earned income. That alone shows just how successful he had become within the very system he now turns his back on.



# Today, Moses has made it clear—he despises Kagame, the Inkotanyi, and everything they stand for. And he chose cyunamo, a sacred time of national mourning, to make his statement. That’s not activism. That’s provocation.



# And before you try to spin this as Rwanda being “anti-gay,” let’s cut that nonsense right here. It’s not illegal to be gay in Rwanda. Nobody is persecuted for that. Side note: I’m flying to Japan in July for a gay wedding—that’s how little it means to us. No one cares. It’s not about who you love—it’s about how you conduct yourself.



# Also—let’s not forget when your dog was tragically killed. Who stepped in to protect you? The same government you now insult. Be honest with yourself: if they hadn’t intervened that day, what do you think would’ve happened? Those guys wouldn’t have stopped at your dog. They would’ve broken your neck too.



# Moses, someone sent you. They sent you a long time ago. And the truth is, many people saw it. But they gave you the benefit of the doubt.

"(Long story, but I hope you'll understand why)
Can you recommend me a book or website on the influence of Tippu Tip in Rwanda? French or English preferred, but other languages are welcome.
I was born in Rwanda in 1988, but didn't grow up there as we left in 1990 to go to a West African country. My parents are very fluent in Kinyarwanda and have even been described by someone of their friends to be very ""Rwandophone"".
So I grew up always thinking that I have parents that are 100% Rwandan and it must have been the case for generations. For my dad, I think that it must be true. I managed to trace down the name of his clan and sub-clan. The name of his sub-clan (as one cousin from his side described it) appeared on a report from 1933 that was made by a Belgian who was sent to do a research in that part of the country (Nyaruguru). 
But for my mother side, it's a complete dead end. She has no idea about what clan she is from. Says that she was not taught anything about it. But growing up in West Africa, many of the locals thought that she was from the north. Part of the Hausa population. Something that we always denied of course. 
Now we are in Europe and even Moroccan merchants, are talking to her as if she's from the Amazigh/Berber population. And again we denied it.
I happened to travel to Morocco in 2022 and what do I get? Local merchants asking me to confirm that I'm not an Amizigh/Berber ( I look more like her). Even Amazighs were talking to me in their local language at first. Then it occurred to me that many of my Rwandan friends always told me that they never thought of me as Rwandan, until they heard my parents speak Kinyarwanda. Most of them thought Somali, Eritrea or some mix from the Caribbean.

Now one of my brothers (looks more like our father) made a Heritage DNA test and it came out as 90% Bantu (east and West). I definitely expected this. But also 4% Middle Eastern, 4% Italian and 2% Eastern Europe (Balkan region). 
I got me thinking, how does a DNA like that end up in (Pre-colonial) Rwanda?
No grand parents or older generation in her side of the family to ask about it unfortunately. And I doubt that a Moroccan got lost in ancient times and ended up in that part of Africa. 

So I'd like to investigate the influence of Tippu Tip in Rwanda to see if this could give me an explanation. I know he had a lot of influence in Eastern Congo and was part Oman. Could any of his ""associates"" get offsprings that crossed the border and ended up in Pre-colonial Rwanda?",en,1.0

My father passed away in January in Rwanda. He was a UK citizen but he would spend alot of time in Rwanda. He had savings in a Rwandan bank account which we are having difficulty transferring to the UK as instructed in my late fathers will.

I’m facing a problem with document certification. The bank requires physical copies of my father’s will and the beneficiaries' passports, all certified by the Rwandan High Commission in London.

However, the Rwandan High Commission UK only provides digital certifications and no longer issues physical versions!! Despite submitting the digitally certified documents, the bank refuses to proceed, insisting on physical copies.

This has left me stuck, as I can’t obtain physical certifications under the High Commission’s current policy. I’ve contacted the bank, but they won’t accept the digital versions. Apprently this is referred to as bureaucratic deadlock.

I’m now considering reaching out to the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINAFFET) for guidance.

"Recent developments in the Congo crisis, including the talks between Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi in Qatar, have led to an agreement on a ceasefire. It is rumored that the leaders of the Alliance of Democratic Forces AFC/M23 rebel group may soon meet with President Tshisekedi in Qatar as well. This raises an interesting possibility: what if Rwanda agrees to sever ties with AFC/M23, halt all funding, and even withdraw all alleged troops from Congolese territory, but the AFC/M23 leadership refuses to stand down?
Given that AFC/M23 now controls a significant portion of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)—an area reportedly twice the size of Rwanda itself and rich in mineral resources—it is conceivable that they could sustain their operations independently. With so much at stake, it seems unlikely that they would readily surrender, even if Rwanda withdraws its support or the Congolese government offers promises of peace and integration into the national army.
Several questions emerge from this scenario. Might AFC/M23 demand autonomy for the territory they currently control? If President Tshisekedi urges them to disarm, what incentives could he offer in exchange, especially considering their demonstrated resolve and battlefield successes against his forces? Tshisekedi’s initial reluctance to negotiate with AFC/M23, followed by his recent request for talks, suggests he recognizes their strength and may fear their capabilities. 
This situation presents no straightforward resolution. Will eastern DRC ultimately gain autonomy, or will AFC/M23 yield to diplomatic pressure? The path forward remains uncertain, with significant implications for the region’s stability and resource control.",en,1.0

"In a significant shift in policy, President Félix Tshisekedi has agreed to participate in direct peace talks with the M23 rebel group, with Angola mediating the discussions set to commence on March 18 in Luanda, the day of my birthday actually😂. This development comes as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) announces a phased withdrawal of its troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), raising concerns about the nation's capacity to manage rebel threats independently. 

Simultaneously, reports indicate that the DRC is negotiating a minerals-for-security agreement with the United States, potentially granting American companies exclusive access to critical minerals in exchange for military assistance against the M23 insurgency. 

These concurrent developments present a complex dilemma for the DRC's future. On one hand, engaging in direct talks with M23 could pave the way for a peaceful resolution to years of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern regions. On the other hand, the withdrawal of SADC forces might leave a security vacuum that could be exploited by various armed groups. Furthermore, while the proposed deal with the U.S. could bolster the DRC's military capabilities, it raises questions about sovereignty and the long-term implications of granting foreign entities significant control over the nation's natural resources.

As these events unfold, the path ahead for the DRC remains uncertain. The outcomes of the upcoming peace talks and the potential U.S. partnership will undoubtedly have profound impacts on the nation's stability and its control over valuable mineral assets. The international community watches closely, hopeful for a resolution that ensures peace, sovereignty, and prosperity for the Congolese people. Especially the Banyamulenge people suffering a lot due to these conflicts.

"I am not Rwandan/Congolese but I’ve been following this conflict and the arguments. This idea that Rwanda and M23 exist to funnel Congolese resources to the West makes 0 sense to me. First of all the smuggling of minerals from Congo to Rwanda would exist with or without M23, for example M23 financed itself early on not by taking control of mines but by taxing the already existing smuggling routes. Why would Rwanda incriminate themselves in this way for no reason when that was already going on fine?

The spike in smuggling from Congo to Rwanda really started after the U.S. passed Dodd Frank. A law that placed extreme regulations on minerals obtained from conflict-zones, this was an attempt to curb the funding of the conflict, but it instead just decimated Congo’s mining sector, which led to US companies simply choosing to not do work in Congo, they instead switched to Rwanda because it also had coltan and had developed traceability systems for its minerals, something Congo didn’t do, and even if they did probably would not have fixed their situation due to corruption. This happened in 2010, meaning the reason the West isn’t in Congo, isn’t because it doesn’t want to or is unable to access its resources due to the Congolese government. So, why prop up Rwanda if they’re feening so much for Congo’s resources? They could just repeal such laws and implement similar deals to what the Chinese are doing.

The Chinese own a stake in 70% of the mines in the DRC, this is due the collapse in the legal mining sector in the DRC following Dodd Frank. The Chinese do not have such laws and while they would prefer to ethically source their minerals, they are not losing sleep over this. So you would think the story goes, China dominates DRC’s mining sector and Rwanda serves the West by being a transit for smuggled Congolese mineral they need, right? WRONG.

The West depends more on China for coltan, and China has the largest control of the supply chain. Around, 70%+ of coltan exported from Rwanda in 2023 went to China, around 60% of all exports from Rwanda to China, excluding other minerals, is Coltan. Most of the West gets its Coltan after it is processed from China and it is shipped to Western countries. Like I said, China controls the entire supply chain, owning most of the mines in DRC and importing most of coltan in Congo and Rwanda to be used in its own processing plants. Rwanda’s exports to China alone was worth more than its export to Europe and the U.S. in 2023. And this is excluding other Asian countries. 

The vast majority of Rwanda’s exports then you would think to the west is of Coltan. Nope that is not the case, the vast majority of Rwanda’s exports to the West are agricultural, things like Coffee, Tea, legumes, vegetables. Rwanda’s biggest export partner is UAE, which took in like 100% of Rwanda’s Gold in 2023. Gold accounted for 65% of Rwanda’s exports and Coltan 7.5%, maybe less. 

Which begs the question, why is the chosen narrative that Rwanda is a tool for the West? To me, at this point it feels like a convenient scapegoat. If anything it makes more sense to say Rwanda is a tool for the UAE or China, but those simply do not hit/resonate as hard given Congo’s history of colonialism, and if I was the DRC it’s simply not smart to incriminate your biggest economic ally, being China. 

Overall, Rwanda’s economy is very much non-dependent on Coltan, and whatever Coltan they have is not sent to the West. In fact in 2023 Rwanda exported more Coltan to South Africa than all of Europe, $210 worth, thus it makes 0 sense that Rwanda would engage militarily for the sake of securing minerals for a Western power. At this point for me, that narrative makes 0 sense to me.

"u/emmbyiringiro made multiple comments about value adding jobs in Rwanda under [this post]( and I wanted to bring this conversation to the forefront in a new post.

One of the reasons most of the products we consume in Rwanda are imported is because of our lack of value adding initiatives. For context, an example of a value adding job is taking crops residue or manure to produce organic fertilizer. This fertilizer can be sold to local farmers or sold abroad to bring in foreign currencies. On the opposite end, a non (or little) value adding activity is being a house broker or buying clothes in Dubai and selling them in Kigali. This type of activity puts a lot of pressure on the Rwandan Franc. The latter requires the Rwandan businessman to take out US Dollars from a local bank, taking that cash to Dubai, bringing those clothes he bought in Dollars to Rwanda and selling them in Rwandan Francs.

  
Question now is how can we get out of this cycle of having everyone venture into this type of activity? How can we as a society or the government encourage people to engage in more value adding activities and businesses?",en,1.0

Muraho.

I’m a 32-year-old Rwandan, but currently I  live in Europe. I was raised in a poor farming family, and my father was very abusive. He insulted me and my siblings with all sorts of disrespectful words. He’s a very loud,  disrespectful man. When I finished high school, I was still living with him and my mother. He continued to abuse and insult me, so I had to move in with a high school friend. I lived there for 10 years until I went abroad to study. I am the youngest of eight siblings, and everyone has their fair share of trauma and abuse from our father.

Now, I have a job, I’m doing well, and I help support my family. However, I still carry the memories of that trauma, and apparently, I’ve never truly forgiven him. What surprises me is how my father is completely unaware of his abuse. Is this a disease? Whenever I talk about him and his behavior, he defends himself, as if he’s a victim. I don’t like it, and it makes me sad. I want an open discussion about this and an apology. It’ll never come apparently. 

Also, every time he calls me, my mood changes, and I lose control. At times, when I think about it, I feel extremely angry and upset. I also have depression. I don’t drink alcohol, no drugs, or anything like that; however, I feel like this experience has ruined my life.

« It is astonishing to see so many analyses locked into the exclusive vilification of small Rwanda, ignoring other crucial realities. »

Here the full text in English (AI translation)


Crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: We Must Face the Situation Head-On




In the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), events are unfolding rapidly. The cities of Goma and Bukavu have been taken by the M23 rebellion, which is composed mostly (but not exclusively) of Rwandophone Congolese and is acting with the support of Rwanda. 

Immediately, a simplistic narrative emerged, portraying the situation as an aggression by Rwandan Tutsis against the Congo.
Kigali's intervention, often described as the mastermind of the operation, is frequently attributed to the sole motivation of ""plundering Congo’s mineral wealth."" However, the coltan mine in Rubaya, seized by M23 rebels in 2024, generates an estimated $300,000 per month, according to the UN—a minuscule sum compared to Rwanda’s resources and the mining royalties paid by Western and Chinese companies to the DRC, which, according to the IMF, officially amounted to approximately $1 billion in 2024.


Yet, the verdict has already been passed. It is astonishing to see so many analyses locked into the exclusive vilification of small Rwanda, ignoring other crucial realities.
A History of Discrimination and Violence
To fully understand the situation, one must consider the history of Congo, a vast country constructed through Belgian colonization and later trapped in tribalism. In Kivu, since the 1960s, Rwandophone populations have faced recurring political and social discrimination. In 1993, all Banyarwanda in North Kivu (both Tutsi and Hutu) became victims of massacres. Among them were descendants of migrant workers brought from Rwanda during colonization, Rwandan refugees from the 1960s, and even longstanding Rwandophone communities (the Banyamulenge), who had lived there for generations—just as Francophone Walloons are at home in Liège.


Anti-Tutsi Sentiment: The Equivalent of Antisemitism
In South Kivu, tens of thousands of Banyamulenge suffered systematic pogroms starting in 1994, following the Rwandan Tutsi genocide. Defeated genocidal troops and militias crossed into the DRC, driven by the same hatred that had led them to massacre nearly a million fellow citizens. Once across the colonial-era border, they targeted Congolese Tutsis in the same systematic manner.
Let’s not forget that in the aftermath of the Rwandan Tutsi genocide, orders from Paris allowed the Rwandan Armed Forces and genocidal militias to find refuge in Zaire (later renamed the DRC) with total impunity. These ruthless killers never truly abandoned their campaign of violence across the region, even crossing into Burundi to attack the Gatumba refugee camp, where 150 people were killed and 106 wounded on August 14, 2004.


Since 2000, these forces have operated under the name Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), continuing their reign of terror in Kivu for over three decades.
Meanwhile, racist propaganda has flourished, depicting Tutsis as ""Nilotics"" and perpetuating the myth that both Rwandan and Congolese Tutsis are ""foreigners"" who supposedly migrated from the Nile region. This rhetoric mirrors the extremist Rwandan media narratives of the early 1990s.

Tragically, even today, calls for a ""final solution"" against all Tutsis in the Great Lakes region persist on social media.
""They should find their way to Rwanda while they still can, [...] or else their bodies will be turned into compost to fertilize the land,"" declared Maï-Maï leader Jean-Baptiste Serugo on X.
Justice Minister Constant Mutamba has repeatedly denounced the presence of ""infiltrators,"" explicitly referring to Congolese Tutsis as mere instruments of Rwanda—just as Rwandan Tutsis were once accused of being ""ibitso"" (accomplices) of a rebellion in early 1990s Rwanda. We know where that rhetoric led.

A Convenient Scapegoat for the Congolese Government
These threats and recurring persecutions led to the emergence of the March 23 Movement (M23). Created by dissident officers of the Congolese army, this self-defense group briefly seized Goma in 2012. At the time, Kinshasa promised to integrate them into the Congolese army and dismantle the FDLR. However, instead of fulfilling these commitments, President Félix Tshisekedi—who took office in 2019—revived anti-Tutsi xenophobic rhetoric to bolster his popularity amid rampant corruption.
Recently, Swiss parliamentarians expressed outrage upon learning that President Tshisekedi’s delegation had spent 444,000 Swiss francs on luxury accommodations during the Davos Economic Forum, at the same time the Swiss parliament was approving an additional three million Swiss francs in aid for suffering Congolese civilians. When these revelations surfaced, the Congolese Minister of Communication blamed the leak on “Rwandan poison”—because from Kinshasa’s perspective, Rwanda is responsible for everything.


President Tshisekedi has found a scapegoat. He has mobilized the FDLR, along with a coalition of Wazalendo (“patriots”) from various armed groups. He has secured reinforcements from approximately 10,000 Burundian soldiers and a regional force dominated by South Africans, in addition to 1,600 highly paid Franco-Romanian mercenaries.


On December 19, 2023, preparing to assemble what seemed to be an invincible force, he declared:
""As soon as the first bullet is fired by those fools, I will convene Parliament to request authorization to declare war on Rwanda.""
We all know what happened next: his regime’s mismanagement led to military collapse and the desperate retreat of various militias.

A Manufactured Crisis?

Is the chaos in eastern DRC truly due to the M23’s attacks, or is it the result of years of militia rule—rife with extortion, rape, and murder?
The crisis is said to have caused ""20 million deaths"", a staggering and questionable figure. Yet, rappers and activists calling to ""free Congo"" draw simplistic parallels, equating ""Kagame with the swastika.""
As a result, the genocide of Rwandan Tutsis is downplayed, forgotten, or even denied. Whether labeled ""Rwandophones"" or ""Swahiliphones,"" the Tutsis remain the primary targets of extermination in Kinshasa and across the DRC.

Congolese bishops recently expressed alarm over the rising number of lynchings targeting so-called ""Rwandans"", who are in reality Congolese Tutsis persecuted because of their ethnicity.

Ignoring the Warning Signs
As in 1994, we must raise awareness about the growing dangers of blind hatred and mass violence.

"French General Jean Varret was head of the military cooperation mission at the French Ministry of Cooperation during this period. In his book *Général, j’en ai pris pour mon grade*, he recounts that he resigned from the French army in 1993, before the Tutsi genocide, because the general staff had dismissed his warnings about the strategy being pursued in Rwanda.

Let’s return to ethnic identity cards. They were systematically checked at numerous roadblocks during the 1990-1994 period to track down Tutsis. The perverse effect of these ethnic identity cards was clearly integrated into the French strategy. Not only did Rwandans check these ethnic identity cards, but so did French soldiers. For example, in 1998, Yvonne Mutimura-Galinier recounted in *Libération,* that she was subjected to an ethnic check by the French in 1993:

 **In February 1993, after the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) launched another attack, security checks were tightened. At roadblocks near Kigali, both French and Rwandan flags were displayed. French soldiers were inspecting identity papers, specifically checking people's ethnicity and origins. One day, about 15 kilometers from Kigali, I was traveling with my sister and sister-in-law when we reached a roadblock manned by French soldiers.** 

**They stopped us and said, ""Show your papers."" We questioned them: ""Why are you checking us? This is a Rwandan matter, not a French one."" They replied, ""Ladies, we’re sorry, but we have to check to see who the enemy is."" We asked, ""How do you determine who the enemy is just by looking at our identity cards?""** 

**Their response was chilling: ""We know very well that the Tutsis are the enemies.***""*

My wife witnessed a French checkpoint in April 1991: a reinforced roadblock in Ruhengeri with two military vehicles equipped with cannons and manned by the French. **A French soldier pulled a Rwandan man from a vehicle after checking his identity card, handed him over to a Rwandan soldier, who in turn handed him to a group of militiamen who beat him with machetes and spiked clubs—under the eyes of the French. She said there were already bodies in the ditch.** The first time I heard this testimony in 1998, I struggled to believe it. But I saw its consistency and the deep emotional impact on my wife, which remains perceptible 28 years later. 

Moreover, in 2005, we discovered notes from the Élysée \[4\] that reinforced her testimony regarding the strategic importance of this town for the French chief of staff. This testimony also aligns with the findings of the French parliamentary report on Colonel Canovas’s conclusions and his April 1991 proposal for civil defense, which relied precisely on the behavior of militiamen in Ruhengeri:

*""In the Ruhengeri area, he observed the population’s aggressive enthusiasm during security sweeps and road checkpoints. At the same time, he noted the fear and despair of those who had fled their homes, seeking refuge in towns and urban centers. To address the insecurity affecting these displaced people south of Volcanoes National Park, he suggested deploying small undercover units (which would become the infamous Interahamwe) disguised as local farmers in sensitive areas. These units would be tasked with eliminating ''isolated rebels''.''*",en,1.0
"I'm a non-binary person wanting to travel to Rwanda. From my own research, I found that LGBT+ people were arbitrarily detained in transit centers in 2021 -2022 because of how they dressed or expressed themselves and would be cited as violating their public decency or deviant behavior laws. Is this still a common trend that occurs in Rwanda? Are there certain areas to stay away from where this still continues to occur? 

I can't find any recent news articles on this trend and don't know if it's because it has stopped occurring or if censorship of these occurrences has prevented the media from publicizing it.

"Hi all,

I have a Gorilla, Golden Monkey, and Chimp trek planned for early March 2025 with a reputable trekking company. I’m a 35-year-old solo female traveler with extensive experience traveling alone.

Given the recent news about the DRC conflict and M23 rebel activity, I’m growing increasingly concerned and considering canceling my trek.

Here’s my itinerary:

* **Arrival:** Picked up from Kigali Airport, drive to Musanze (overnight).
* **Day 1:** Golden Monkey trek in Volcanoes NP (Rwanda), then cross the border to Bwindi Impenetrable Forest (Uganda).
* **Day 2:** Gorilla trekking in Bwindi → Transfer to Lake Bunyonyi (boat ride, overnight stay).
* **Day 3:** Drive to Kibale National Park (via Fort Portal), visit Bigodi Swamp.
* **Day 4:** Chimp trekking in Kibale → Transfer to Entebbe (overnight near the airport).

"I think the Rwandan government is right. 

Of course this is regrettable but it shows why „foreign“ is problematic. 
If you really believe what you advertise in aid brochures like „feeding children“, „empowering women“ … how can you justify threatening to cut this aid for political reasons. 

It is rarely about „feeding children „ : it is about creating dependency and control. 


From the press release 

Rwanda will neither be intimidated nor blackmailed at the expense of its national security. Our sole objective is to ensure a secure border and to put a definitive end to violent ethnic extremism policies in our region. Rwanda needs peace and a lasting solution, and no one should continue to tolerate these cycles of conflict that keep repeating due to the inability of the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the international community, decade after decade, to fulfill their commitments to dismantle the UN-sanctioned genocidal FDLR militia and protect the rights of minorities.

The DRC's legal action centers on accusations that Rwanda has provided support to the M23 rebel group, which has been implicated in numerous atrocities against civilians in the conflict-ridden North Kivu region. The DRC is seeking reparations for the victims, the withdrawal of Rwandan troops, and an end to Rwanda's alleged support for M23.

""Neymar said he was left speechless after making his first appearance for Santos since [returning to the Brazilian club]( where he began his illustrious career.

Neymar confirmed in January that he was returning to his boyhood club, 12 years after he first left to join Barcelona as one of the most promising youngsters ever to come out of Brazil. Days before, it was announced that [the superstar and Saudi club Al-Hilal had mutually agreed]( to part ways, 18 months after the forward joined in a high-profile move for a reported €90 million ($98.5M).

And on Wednesday, Neymar stepped back onto the field at the Urbano Caldeira stadium when he came off the bench at the start of the second half against Botafogo in the Brazilian Paulista Championship.

His arrival was accompanied by loud cheers from the Santos faithful. Before the match started, Neymar received a spectacular light show as he emerged from the tunnel.

Santos led 1-0 when the former Barça man – who also celebrated his 33rd birthday on Wednesday – took to the field, but Botafogo equalized through a Alexandre de Jesus header from a corner in the 67th minute.

Botafogo was reduced to 10 men shortly afterwards when Wallison was shown a red card for a foul on Neymar, but despite having the numerical advantage, Santos was unable to retake the lead.""

"I'm curious about the salary range for software engineers (SWE) in Kigali, particularly for those working at **local** companies versus **international** companies. I'm especially interested in the following:

1. **Junior-level SWE salaries** (Entry-level)
2. **Mid-level SWE salaries** (2-5 years of experience)
3. **Senior-level SWE salaries** (5+ years of experience)

How much can a software engineer typically expect to earn in Kigali in these categories? Does working for a multinational company offer significantly higher pay compared to local firms?

Also, how do factors like skill set (e.g., AI, cloud computing) and cost of living in Kigali impact these salaries?

I hope it's not 300 USD for Mid-level, lol!

I'm going to visit Rwanda this week but I'm little bit concerned about situation in Rubavu area according to conflict between DRC & m23... 

We are going to volcanoes national park,  mount Bisoke and the plan is to stay (and we have already booked hotel whoch is approximately 2.8 km far away from borders DRC) in the outskirts of the Gisenyi city near to lake Kivu.

So my question is, if its safe to stay there for one night and then continue to the south or its better to avoid Rubavu area.

"**Greetings!**

Finding rentals in Rwanda is challenging, so we took the initiative to build a solution called **Kodesha** ([kodesha.rw](—a mobile app that simplifies the entire house-hunting process.

We have released **version 1.0.0** on the Play Store: [Kodesha on Google PlayStore](

**Current Features:**

\- *Price and location filtering*

\- *Posting a ""request""* with a description of the house you’re looking for

\- *Easily starting a conversation* with a broker once you're interested

\- *Listing a house for rent*

**What We're Working On:**

\- *A review and rating system* for brokers

There is a lack of transparency in the rental market, and some brokers take advantage of it. This issue worsens if they realize you are a foreigner or don’t speak Kinyarwanda.

As someone who has rented in Kigali for \*\*eight years\*\*, first as a student and now after, I’ve encountered brokers I would never want to deal with again. With a review system in place, brokers would have to think twice before jeopardizing their reputation and future business.

Since renting in Rwanda is a topic that comes up frequently, I'd love to hear your suggestions! What features do you think would make the rental process easier for you?",en,1.0

But when I speak to alot of these girls, they seem eager to meet and even have sex but then often times the question of money comes up?! Alot of these girls are expecting to be paid for showing up to a date and possibly doing more.

"Many news outlets covering the conflict in eastern Congo overlook two crucial aspects: 
(1) the presence of the genocidal FDLR militia and 
(2) the marginalization of Rwandese Speaking Congolese citizens. 
The FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) is composed of remnants from the genocidal regime that operated in Rwanda prior to 1994. For nearly three decades, they have been active in eastern Congo, with the stated goal of attacking Rwanda and restoring the pre-1994 government. In recent developments, the FDLR has openly cooperated with the Congolese army and received public support from the Congolese government.
(On 2)
A significant portion of the population in eastern Congo speaks Kinyarwanda. They have inhabited this region for centuries -  which was part of the Rwandan Kingdom. The region was placed within during the colonial partition of Africa. These Kinyarwanda-speaking Congolese have long been marginalized and labeled as “Rwandans,” often forced to flee. Since 1994, they have been targeted by the FDLR and other militias seeking to drive them out of their ancestral lands to Rwanda. The Congolese government has repeatedly failed to protect them as citizens, and in some instances, has viewed them with suspicion rather than recognizing their legitimate status as Congolese.
This may helps understand the position of the East African Community which asks the Congolose government to address those two issues : to dismantle the FDLR militia and to enter in dialogue with M23 to address the second issue.",en,1.0

I know that Rwanda is trying to encouraged  more tourists to visit Rwanda, so the impression tourists get of the country and it’s people is important but that shouldn’t mean putting white people on a pedestal either in my opinion. 

 I guess it’s just disappointing to see. I’m Rwandese btw but grew up in the west, so I was always around white people, so I am used to being treated differently because of my race but I don’t expect any less from people there. However while I’m in Rwanda I thought the last thing I had to think about was being treated differently because of my race as well. Also because there are fewer white people there, it somehow makes it more noticeable when they are given preferential treatment compared to everyone else.
